    "title": "Eurovision 2025: The provocative Estonian pop song that has caused outrage in Italy",
    "content": "One of the most controversial entries in the Eurovision song contest is Espresso Macchiato by Estonia's Tommy Cash. It mocks Italian stereotypes, and there have been calls to ban it. The track by Estonian rapper and singer Tommy Cash is the country's entry into the 2025 Eurovision Song Contest, which takes place next week. When its inclusion in the competition was announced, some reacted with bemusement, and others with outrage, especially in Italy, due to the way Cash seems to mock the country with his faux-operatic, broken Italian accent and deployment of Italian stereotypes. \"I love anything trashy,\" Cash tells the BBC, giggling, explaining the simple thinking behind the track, which some Italians have even called on to be banned from the competition. Espresso Macchiato is hardly the first song to send up Italian stereotypes: see the Italian-American novelty songs of the war and post-war period like Mambo Italiano and many others. And self-parody is part and parcel of Eurovision, particularly among Eastern European acts – see for example Poland's 2014 entry My Slowianie, which parodied the country's gender stereotypes, or Greece's satirical 2013 song Alcohol is Free, which dealt with the Greek financial crisis. However Cash's Eurovision entry may be the first to parody another competing nation. It's a bold choice for Eurovision, an event that has functioned as much more than a mere singing competition since its inception.   Today, Eurovision sees more than 35 countries, mainly from Europe, participate while it holds the distinction of being one of the world's longest-running annual television broadcasts, drawing a huge global audience of hundreds of millions. It fosters interconnection among European nations, becoming fodder for small talk and providing a sense of shared purpose and mythos across the continent. And while its rules explicitly forbid \"lyrics, speeches, gestures of a political or similar nature\", Eurovision has served a political purpose. Since the inaugural contest in 1956, when it was set up by Marcel Bezençon, the director of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), to help unify a fractured post-war Europe, Eurovision has served as a stage for \"cultural exchange, diplomacy, and national branding\", according to one study. \"The purpose of Eurovision is to unite Europe,\" says musicologist Anna G Piotrowska. \"It's educational, too, a way [for audiences] to learn about a country's traditions and how its people express themselves today.\" In that way, we might liken Eurovision to a very mild display of national propaganda, with songs often designed to showcase their country's cultural values and appeal. Fittingly, media scholar Göran Bolin argued that the Eurovision Song Contest is the musical equivalent of a world's fair, a large-scale international exhibition that brings together countries from around the globe to showcase their cultures and achievements.  For Estonia, Eurovision carries particularly weighty significance. The country has only won the competition once, for their 2001 entry Everybody. One commentator described that win as the single most important event in Estonia's history since it secured independence from the Soviet Union 10 years earlier. Indeed, the victory was seen as a crowning moment for the country's successful reintegration back into Europe as it sought a clean break from its communist past. Now, with Estonia currently trying to phase out school pupils being taught in the Russian language, it is seeking to re-establish its cultural independence. It is odd, then, that it has plumped for a song this year that has nothing to do with its own culture. What's more, Cash's entry appears to satirise the very notion of national representation upon which Eurovision rests.  Given that the competition is such a useful tool for cultural diplomacy, why, then, is Cash entering with a song solely devoted to mocking Italian stereotypes? \"Because it's funny,\" he says, which is one of his common catchphrases. Cash treats whatever tickles him with grave seriousness, crafting his comedy with great meticulousness. But his pranksterish attitude has rankled certain Italians, as well as members of Eurovision's year-round international fanbase. While filming recently in Brazil, one Eurovision fan gave Cash a piece of her mind, he recalls. \"She told me that half of the fanbase loved me and the other half couldn't stomach me, because they feel I'm mocking Eurovision and just treating it as some big joke,\" he says. \"That's just not entirely true. If this were all some big joke for me, I wouldn't be putting all this work into it. I'd just stand at the back of the stage, drink coffee, and wait for the lights to come back on.\" In fact, Cash says he's treating Eurovision like a \"boxing camp\". Speaking to him two months out from the competition, he says he's already rehearsing five full days a week. Cash's taste for parodying other cultures is not limited to Italy. Last year, he released Untz Untz, a song whose title is derived from the stereotypical sound of a dance beat, which was a clear spoof of German techno culture. Indeed, Untz Untz, he says, was the catalyst for setting his Eurovision journey in motion. He received astonishing national support for it, with the official Estonian Olympic team posting his extremely risqué video on their social media. It became a building block for Cash's Eurovision journey, suggesting to him that he would have the necessary national backing to enter, as was proven, when he won Estonia's Eurovision pre-selection contest Eesti Laul in February. \"It also proved to me that this is the year when I do stuff that I haven't done before,\" he says. \"My career is pretty colourful, and I've done so many interesting projects. You know, why not have Eurovision on my Wikipedia page and put my name in the history books of my country?\" Born Tommy Tammemets in 1991, around the time of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Cash grew up in a poor district of Tallinn. After getting expelled from school, he transcribed his childhood experiences into rap verses. \"The year was grey, 1991, when Tommy got produced by some chemical waste,\" he spat on his 2013 breakthrough Guez Whoz Back. He later became one of Eastern Europe's foremost provocateurs, billing himself the \"Kanye East\" of Estonia. The wickedly mischievous humour he brandishes in his songs is deliberately absurdist, inspired as much by Andy Warhol as by Eurotrash acts like Scooter and Basshunter. He has collaborated with everyone from Charli XCX to a rapper named MC Bin Laden. Outside of his music, he has gone viral for posing on horseback in a McDonald's drive-thru in Tallinn, and showing up at Paris Fashion Week wearing pyjamas and a wrap-around duvet. Espresso Macchiato, he says, was the product of his frequent trips to Italy, where he typically goes to record. The words Espresso Macchiato simply entered Cash's head, he says, with \"zero references to anything else, zero anything; it was just one of those songs\". He then built out the song around the most obvious Italian identifiers he could think of.  While Cash has offended some Italians, some others have been impressed.  Paolo Prato, a lecturer in Italian Studies at John Cabot University in Rome, acknowledges that Cash is invoking \"a predigested version of Italy\", but says his performance in the Espresso Macchiato music video is still \"credible to many Italians\", as his choreography appears to mimic the springy movements of beloved Italian showman Adriano Celentano. Still, Prato notes, within Italy, Cash's song has been, in a word, \"controversial\". On one hand, the song has gained famous Italian fans, such as the \"grannies from Ostuni\", who have danced to Cash's song on TikTok, achieving semi-viral status. On the other hand, Codacons, the Italian association responsible for consumer rights, has requested the song's disqualification from the competition, citing offensive stereotypes, while politician Marco Centinaio, another among the song's leading critics, has said: \"those who insult Italy should stay out of Eurovision\".   However Lauri Bambus, the Estonian Ambassador to the Italian Republic says that, a few criticisms, particularly in regards to Cash's \"broken Italian grammar\", aside, he has personally received \"very positive feedback\" about the song. \"Italians love catchy melodies and do understand jokes,\" he says, adding that \"Espresso Macchiato can often be heard in cafeterias in Italy and people seem to enjoy it\". Cash was also welcomed with enthusiasm when he performed on popular Italian channel LA7. \"They loved us,\" says Cash, \"I had so many Italians come up to meet in the street after saying 'you're a legend!'\".  While the negative reactions to the song has drawn have been severe, such positive reception elsewhere suggests that some Italians take the stereotypes about their culture in their stride. \"Generally speaking, [Italian stereotypes] are constructed from the outside,\" says Prato. They are a way for tourists and foreign observers to comically simplify their impressions of Italy and its rich culture, he explains, and are largely based on the country's food these days, since, \"food identifies Italy's history and anthropology more than anything else\". Italian food, such as pasta, pizza and ice cream, has been exported around the world thanks to one of the largest voluntary migrations in global history, with 13 million Italians moving abroad between 1880 and 1915. \"[This] has significantly contributed to its global reputation,\" says Prato – but also left it more vulnerable than other cultures to widespread stereotyping. Indeed, as Italians emigrated to the US in large waves during the late 19th and early 20th Centuries, anti-Italian sentiment also began to foment in the country, and Italian stereotypes took on a negative valence. Since many Italian immigrants were from agrarian backgrounds and competed for low-paying jobs, \"they were associated with poverty, dirt, and a backward mentality\", says Prato. However as the Italian migrants integrated further into the larger population, the perception of Italian culture became more favourable. \"Pizza, pasta, coffee and many other Italian culinary habits changed status and became associated with a positive image of the country,\" says Prato. As a result, Italian-American musicians of the 1950s, including Dean Martin and Louis Prima, released songs with jubilant references to pizza, pasta, wine, and cappuccino. Then, in the 60s and early 70s, with the rise of Italian-American mafia movies, most notably The Godfather, Italians took centre stage in US and global culture in a whole different way.  More like this: • How Abba's Eurovision win divided Sweden • Why Gen Z have become Eurovision's biggest fans • How Sabrina Carpenter's Espresso became a phenomenon Italy is not only a cultural behemoth, but also a vital part of Eurovision's history. The competition was originally modelled after the popular Festival della Canzone Italiana, a singing event held in the Italian resort of San Remo. Nowadays, anyone who watches Eurovision can expect the contest to feature a fair share of its own stereotypes, with its mix of eccentric high-energy pop songs, earnest power-ballads and the requisite heavy metal entry (this year's comes courtesy of Portugal). This is fertile ground for Cash, who says he loves \"to play with stereotypes\". But behind the tomfoolery lies a much more earnest impulse. \"My purpose as an artist is to show people, 100 percent, that a person from Estonia can do anything,\" he says. \"We can impact the world and bring something original to the stage.\" John Kennedy O'Connor, a regular Eurovision commentator, says that despite of, or even because of all the controversy, Cash's song is already the most well-known heading into the competition. Even if he doesn't come out on top on the night, he's already won. \"He'll still be remembered on Monday,\" says O'Connor. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  For more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "title": "The stunning retro space-age homes that are perfect for today",
    "content": "Space-age style is skyrocketing in pop culture – in celebrities' homes, at global design fairs and even in blockbuster films. We look back at the stunning retro-futuristic origins of 2025's biggest interiors aesthetic, and ask, why now? From aerodynamic cars to voluminous moonscape-style seating, popular culture and design is going cosmic. Some architects, designers, film-makers and galleries are looking, if not to Star Wars' \"galaxy far, far away\", then at least beyond the Earth's atmosphere for their inspiration. Coming out in July, Marvel Studios' latest film, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, boasts a living room with a circular sunken sofa arrangement and glossy white circular side tables, and cars with oversized fins. Not your typical styling for an action-adventure blockbuster. Down here in the real world, some major US interior designers have made the space-age aesthetic highly fashionable. LA- and Milan-based Giampiero Tagliaferri is among the designers who espouses a \"California Space Age\" aesthetic for the homes of tech moguls, art collectors, fashion creatives and pop stars. One such has a shiny white futuristic spiral staircase that wouldn't have been out of place in Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film, 2001: A Space Odyssey. And US interior designer Kelly Wearstler's own Malibu beach house is full of space-age design, like the 1970s sofa and chaise longue by Afra and Tobia Scarpa, and the 1957 Digamma chair with its four splayed feet by Ignazio Gardella.   Meanwhile, furniture brands like Paulin, Paulin, Paulin have been quick to spot a trend, or perhaps are leading it. The family business is reissuing space-age designs from the early 1970s by influential French furniture designer Pierre Paulin. In particular, his Dune Ensemble modular seating arrangement with its echoes of a planetary surface has become a favourite among music-industry types and influencers. Famously private singer Frank Ocean, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea, rapper Travis Scott, Justin Bieber and Kim Kardashian are all reported to have one.  Galleries and design fairs are picking up on this retro-futuristic nostalgia. On show at Vitra Design Museum in Germany's Weil am Rhein is Science Fiction Design: From Space Age to Metaverse. It explores how the designers of the Space Age supplied film directors with the ideal furnishings for their science fiction movies: Olivier Mourgue's 1960s Djinn seating series in 2001: A Space Odyssey; Eero Aarnio's 1971 Tomato Chair in Barry Sonnenfeld's Men in Black (1997); and Paulin's 1966 Ribbon Chair in Denis Villeneuve's Blade Runner 2049 (2017). At this spring's Milan Design Week, the hottest ticket was for the installation created by fashion house Loro Piana and the achingly cool furniture designers Dimorestudio. In La Prima Notte di Quiete, they presented a kind of idealised cinematic 1970s apartment which was pure Italo-Californian space-age chic: sunken conversation pits, round beds, cascades of cuboid wall-lights, retro seating, electric green carpet. Space-age styling was also on display at Brussels' vast Brafa Art Fair. Each year, Delen Private Bank, which has an extraordinary collection of Modernist art and mid-century furniture, creates a suite of rooms at the fair as the ultimate apartment. This time, its sassiest room was pure space age – red gloss walls redolent of Verner Panton's Visiona exhibitions, with that most space-age of symbols: the Joe Colombo Elda Chair. This aesthetic has its roots, of course, in the first space race, which set off when the Soviets launched the Sputnik satellite in 1957, and continued throughout the 1960s with Nasa's Apollo programme. These events dominated the global media, and people across the world uncynically embraced the idea that humanity had entered a new era. \"It seemed only natural that objects and spaces should reflect this,\" Peter Martin, author of Space Age Design: Icons of the Movement, tells the BBC. With that backdrop, pre-war design and architecture suddenly looked out of date. Instead, the height of cool was the forward-looking sophistication of Eero Aarnio's 1963 Pallo or Ball Chair, ideally placed within a modernist home. More like this: • How to transform your home with art • The pioneering building that scandalised Paris • The nine colours that can transform your home And it wasn't just furniture that leant into this space-age fever. Cars grew massive tailfins and airports began to resemble spaceships, like Eero Saarinen's TWA Flight Center in New York. The trend accelerated with the moon landing at the end of the 1960s, and was reflected in TV and cinema. As well as 2001: A Space Odyssey, there was the iconic TV series Star Trek. In music, there was the Telstar single by the Tornadoes, and in fashion, several designers unveiled futuristic looks, including Paco Rabanne's iconic 1968 gold-chain Space Age dress. There was also a practical reason for space-age design's popularity. It arrived with the advent of newly available materials, which had been developed in the war years and by the mid-1950s were finding their way into the workshops and studios of a new generation of designers. For a while, plastic became synonymous with what we now think of as space-age designers. As Cristina Bargna, head of the Plastic Design Collection at Design Museum Brussels says in Martin's book, \"In the 1950s, plastic represented possibilities, freedom, and joy. The freedom of shape; the possibility to create new furniture, to furnish new houses – a material that spoke to a new generation with the desire to live differently. Plastic was no longer a material that imitated what had come before. It started to embody the future; it created a completely new vision of reality.\" The other factor was mass production, which exploded during the war years for munitions, and then pivoted afterwards towards the burgeoning consumer culture. Savvy designers allied themselves with manufacturers. \"The story of space-age design is in many ways a story of partnership between designers and manufacturers. Joe Colombo with Kartell; Eero Saarinen with Knoll; Verner Panton with Vitra; Peter Ghyczy with Elastogran,\" Martin writes in Space Age Design. The peak of space-age design was in the immediate aftermath of the moon landings. \"We know now that what looked like the start of things was in reality the end of things – we'd soon leave the moon and not return,\" Martin says, \"But in the euphoria of the moon landings, things could not have looked more different.\" At this point, space was the hottest topic, and global mainstream interest injected a massive shot of energy into space-age design and influence. It was seen everywhere, from David Bowie's Space Oddity – released a month after the landing – to JVC's space-helmeted Videosphere television. And at a time when it seemed reasonable to assume that we'd be living in space within a few decades, designers considered how that might look. Sofa design is a classic example. \"Modular sofas had been around since the 1940s, but now they became sprawling and heroic, made for fabulous, futuristic lifestyles,\" Martin says. Rigid forms were out; enveloping, sensual, organic shapes were in. These were statement sofas that could belong in a Lake Como villa or on a space station orbiting the moon. Sitting upright was out; sofas were for slumbering, socialising or partying. Out of this era came two giants that can be claimed for the space-age design movement: the iconic 1973 Togo designed by Michel Ducaroy for Ligne Roset; and the 1972 Camaleonda by Mario Bellini for B&B Italia. Both are still in production and remain extremely sought after. And now the aesthetic is back. A sense of rediscovery, a hefty dose of nostalgia and a new sense of competition are all contributing to the revival of space-age design. Nostalgia for the space race itself was kicked off in 2022, when Buzz Aldrin's Apollo 11 jacket sold for $2.8m (£2.3m) at Sotheby's in New York. Since then, space memorabilia has become a huge market. And last year, Tom Hanks' immersive show The Moonwalkers – recreating the Apollo mission – was the main attraction at London's Lightroom. \"This is in large part because of what that era represents – the pioneering sensibility of western nations that embraced the future with a sense of mission, \" Martin says. Feeding into this interest in the first space age is the fact that we are now on the cusp of the second. Nasa's Artemis programme is about to return to the moon, with humans slated to land in 2027 for the first time since the 1970s. This time, the race is international, with China, India and private US companies competing for space primacy.  This is manifesting in vibrant design from several regions, such as the work of Chinese-born Peng Zheng (now senior product designer at Zoom in California) and Eason Zhu (founder of Hangzhou's multidisciplinary design studio Fununit Design & More). Designers like these, says Martin, are \"creating a vision of new ways of living that are entirely unhindered by the baggage of what went before\". Space Age Design: Icons of the Movement by Peter Martin is published by teNeues. -- If you liked this story sign up for The Essential List newsletter, a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

    "title": "The lost 1934 novel that gave a chilling warning about the horrors of Nazi Germany",
    "content": "Published years before WW2, Sally Carson's prescient novel captures the dawn of Nazi tyranny in a small German town – and remains relevant today. Eighty years after VE Day, enthusiasm for the World War Two novel remains undimmed. Demand for tales of wartime Europe, always healthy, has swelled notably since the publication of Anthony Doerr's lyrical All the Light We Cannot See, awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 2015 and subsequently adapted into a Netflix series. Love stories, battle stories, codebreaker stories, resistance stories, concentration camp stories – all have landed on bestseller lists around the world. And while many novelists in this sub-genre have drawn skillfully on documents, letters and eye-witness accounts eight decades old, the world is unlikely ever again, at this far remove, to see a new work of fiction based on personal experience of that era. Which is one reason Crooked Cross, republished this spring by Persephone Books, is such an extraordinary read. The author, Sylvia \"Sally\" Carson, a young Englishwoman, was inspired by visits to friends in Bavaria in the early 1930s to write a novel about the dawn of Nazi tyranny in a small German town. The celebrated US novelist EL Doctorow, author of Ragtime, Billy Bathgate and other works of fiction set in the past, once said: \"The historian will tell you what happened. The novelist can tell you what it felt like.\" And Carson's achievement is to bring to vivid life the fictional Kluger family, residing near the mountains south of Munich who over the course of six months – Christmas Eve 1932 to Midsummer Night 1933 – see their lives shattered. Carson wrote Crooked Cross – the title refers to the swastika symbol adopted by the Nazis – at speed. It was published in 1934, a year after the events she recounts. Reviews were laudatory, and Carson turned her novel into a play that premiered at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in 1935, transferring to London's West End two years later. Carson proved remarkably prescient about the horrors to come, and yet after her premature death, in 1941 from breast cancer, her novel sank into obscurity. Persephone's decision to reissue it now is a wise and welcome one. The action opens when Hans and Rosa Kluger, and their three adult children – daughter Lexa, and sons Helmy and Erich – gather for the Christmas holiday. Life is hard in Depression-era Germany. Herr Kluger's salary at the Post Office has been cut, eldest son Helmy is out of work, and Erich's seasonal job as a ski instructor requires humiliating catering to the whims of rich women. But Christmas is \"a time for the knitting together of personal happiness, and of completing the magic circle of their family,\" Carson writes. Lexa's handsome and successful fiancé, the young surgeon Moritz Weissman, is included in all the celebrations. When Helmy and Lexa take charge of decorating the tree – the two siblings have always been close – the festive setting is described precisely, with a passing reference to \"Helmy's picture of Hitler\" that sits on the piano, decorated with fir twigs, like everything else in the cosy house. The scene lulls the reader into believing, despite the flicker of menace, that nothing can break this loyal, decent and loving clan. A month later, in January 1933, Hitler is appointed Chancellor, and the Machtergreifung, as the Germans call the Nazi consolidation of power, begins. Within days, Helmy is rewarded for his early allegiance to the Nazis, and their promises to make the nation prosperous again, with a job as the local party secretary; Moritz, who has a Jewish father, is dismissed from the Munich clinic where he works. Carson demonstrates compassion for all her characters, alongside razor-sharp insight into their very human weaknesses. Helmy, a sensitive, conscientious man, nonetheless falls into line with evil ideology. He tries to persuade his sister that, in the new reality, she must break off her engagement and never see Moritz again. Lexa resists, clinging to the hope that in faraway Berlin, Hitler will be tossed out of government. Instead, as the mountain meadows turn green in the spring, the family's world darkens further. Erich quits his servile job to join the brownshirts, and swaggers around town in his uniform and jackboots – the Kluger parents feel intense pride, although Herr Kluger, a veteran of World War One, remains wary about another bloody conflict. The idealistic Helmy attends a Nazi rally and is mesmerised. Carson writes: \"He had no warning of the destruction that would be caused by the setting free of that power for which he now shouted as hoarsely as the others… Hitler was to them like some splendid deliverer; a god… Their arms flew out in the same signal – a forest of stretching brown arms with the fingers pointing to the little god with a toothbrush moustache. Heil Hitler!\" Moritz, stripped of work and income, no longer even permitted to borrow books from the public library, falls into despondency. Seeking a carefree evening, Lexa persuades him to take her to a dance. On the crowded floor, while doing the foxtrot, the two accidently bump against another couple. Moritz turns to apologise. \"Blast you!... you filthy Jew… Get out of the way,\" the other man shouts. Carson told the Bradford Observer newspaper how she had heard these exact words thrown at the Jewish man who partnered her at a dance hall while she was on holiday in Bavaria. On Midsummer Night, when the violence simmering under the surface in this idyllic corner of Germany explodes into clear view, Lexa conclusively chooses her love for Moritz over all other loyalties, and the results are devastating. (To say more would be to ruin the story.) More like this: • The fake Hitler diaries that fooled the press • How Oskar Schindler saved 1200 Jewish people in WW2 • How music saved a cellist's life in Auschwitz The novel, which concerned itself only with the domestic realm, still shows with chilling force how a civilised nation could be captured by authoritarianism. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 news programme Today, Francesca Beauman – the historian who is the editorial director of Persephone Books – cited a review in the Acton Gazette at the time of the book's publication. \"Crooked Cross is more truthful than telegraphed reports; it is fairer than propaganda, and it is more interesting than either.\" Not all of Carson's contemporaries desired to hear the warning embedded in Crooked Cross. When her play moved to the London stage in 1937, some in Britain blasted it as anti-German, and the Lord Chamberlain's office insisted every \"Heil Hitler\" be removed. Much of the British establishment at that time hoped to peacefully co-exist with the bellicose regime in Berlin. Some readers will be quick to draw modern parallels, especially to the rise of right-wing populism around the world, and the propensity for young men to be seduced by extremist movements, when they feel – as millions did in 1930s Germany – purposeless, disaffected or lost. But the real question that Crooked Cross raises is personal. What would you do if the people you love begin to espouse ideas you hate? Now that Carson's indelible portrait of the tragic Kluger family has resurfaced, it warrants a permanent place in the growing canon of World War Two literature. Crooked Cross by Sally Carson is published by Persephone Books, which reprints neglected fiction and nonfiction mostly by women.  Clare McHugh is the author of the historical novel, The Romanov Brides. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  For more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "title": "'I did stunts for my own pleasure': The terrifying feats of French film legend Jean-Paul Belmondo",
    "content": "Decades before Tom Cruise was making audiences gasp, the Gallic star was getting up to even more hair-raising exploits on screen – sometimes with few safety measures. One of modern Hollywood's great leading men, Tom Cruise, is to receive a fellowship from the British Film Institute this May, alongside a season celebrating his career. Cruise is described by the institution as a \"daredevil action star\", and someone with a \"dedication to reinventing the cinema spectacle\" – traits exemplified most of all by his role in the Mission: Impossible series, the latest of which, Christopher McQuarrie's Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, is out this month. However, while it's difficult to think a star of similar stature who performs such awe-inspiring stunts today, Cruise has a forebear who is just as daring, if not more so. That star is Jean-Paul Belmondo. Belmondo, or Bébel as he is sometimes known, is familiar to many as a figure of 1960s French New Wave cinema. Though beginning his career in the early 1950s with work at Paris's Théâtre de l'Atelier, he soon began acting in films. Nouvelle Vague classics such as Jean-Luc Godard's Pierrot le Fou (1966), Une Femme est une Femme (1961) and Breathless (1960) showed Belmondo working with ease in arthouse cinema, reflecting his intellectual background: his father was a sculptor and his mother an artist. However, Belmondo had an incredibly wide range. In the same period as he was acting in Godard's avant-garde films, Belmondo worked on many different kinds of film, from French noirs such as Jean-Pierre Melville's Le Doulos (1962) and Claude Sautet's Classe tous risques (1960), to straight dramas such as Melville's Léon Morin, Priest (1961) and, most importantly, Un Singe en Hiver (1962) by Henri Verneuil. As the years went by, it would be Verneuil who would shape Belmondo's later career thanks to his underrated thriller Peur sur la ville (1975). The film turned the actor into a proto-Cruise figure whose physical prowess and fearless stunt work would ultimately define him for French audiences. Celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, and known in English-language territories as both Fear Over the City and The Night Caller, Verneuil's film is relatively simple in terms of narrative. Belmondo plays Letellier, a Parisian police commissaire who, much like Clint Eastwood in Don Siegel's Dirty Harry (1971), doesn't play by the rules. He's haunted by a fatal incident in which criminal Marcucci (Giovanni Cianfriglia) managed to escape after a bank heist. However, Letellier and his sidekick Moissac (Charles Denner) are faced with another problem: a serial killer stalking and murdering women across Paris. It doesn't take long for the two cases to become intertwined as Letellier relentlessly pursues both villains across the city, with much derring-do and many gobsmacking stunts along the way. Peur sur la ville was not well-received by the critics at the time, who were unhappy with Verneuil following American trends in depicting cops as cowboy-ish gunslingers breaking the rules to clean up cities. \"Through some odd work with the trans-Atlantic scissors,\" wrote Richard Eder of The New York Times, \"the Franco-Italian production Night Caller by Henri Verneuil seems to be two completely different movies, neither of them up to much.\" Eder did say that Belmondo's stunts were entertaining, though; generally, this was the only aspect that was reviewed positively. Equally, French film criticism pulled no punches. Film magazine Positif suggested that the film \"evoked the worst of American police films\", in particular in its \"total absence of social background\". What it did have in abundance, however, was Belmondo acting as if he had a death wish. And audiences loved it. His shift from arthouse darling to action star was considered unusual at the time by some – though it wasn't quite as stark as it appeared. \"When I was young, I did stunts for my own pleasure,\" Belmondo once admitted. \"When I was at the conservatoire, I hung from the balconies. I always had a taste for stunts.\" Professor Lucy Bolton, a senior lecturer in film studies at Queen Mary University of London, says Belmondo's desire for physical roles made sense, given his background. \"He was very physical, very sporty, and had a short career as an amateur boxer,\" she tells the BBC. \"Apparently, he stopped because he didn't like his face getting so rearranged!\" Muriel Zagha, critic and co-host of French culture podcast Garlic & Pearls, agrees that there were seeds of Belmondo the daredevil in his earlier career. \"Of course, Belmondo was criticised for that shift,\" she tells the BBC, \"which must have seemed to some incomprehensible. But, in hindsight, I see continuity between those two phases of his career. Belmondo said in interviews that there was no difference between the 'pinch' (pincement) of apprehension he felt before doing a stunt and the stage fright he felt before walking on stage. And they were both feelings he enjoyed.\" Peur sur la ville very much embodies the former pinch rather than the latter. In spite of the criticism, Verneuil's film was a huge success. Released on Belmondo's 42nd birthday, the film stayed at the top of the French box office for two months, only falling to Ken Russell's rock opera collaboration with The Who, Tommy (1975). It was the second-most popular film in France that year, too, just trumped by John Guillermin's equally stunt-filled The Towering Inferno (1974). Clearly, the public did not share the critics' dismissiveness, and Belmondo's stunts played a huge role in the film's word-of-mouth spread. For Peur sur la ville's power as a film lies not so much in the drama of its narrative as it does in the authenticity of its action. As Belmondo said in an interview about the film at the time, \"I'm sure that when I do a stunt for Henri, I'll be very well filmed. People will see it's the actor doing it and it would ruin it if you couldn't see that.\" Initially, the film lulls the viewer into thinking that it may be another straightforward procedural, but it isn't long before the action cranks up a notch, and the actor is climbing precariously over the balcony of a flat. Zoom in on the sequence, and you can see how limited the safety measures were. Behind-the-scenes shots taken during filming by photographer Michel Ginfray show one rope attached to Belmondo, but even this is visible only in the shots where he is climbing over the balcony; his initial approach to it, sidling along a ledge, seems to be done without any precautions. Peur sur la ville is a film haunted by heights, right from its opening montage of Paris's growing business quarter. Building on some of the trends unfolding in American cinema of the period, in particular the sense of being surveyed from the new, modern towers of glass and steel in films such as Dirty Harry and Alan J Pakula's Klute (1971), Verneuil fills his screen with vertigo-including shots. However, as the film progresses, the key reason for this focus on high-rises becomes apparent: they're really a dangerous obstacle course for Belmondo's Harry Callahan-esque Letellier to tackle. As his character says to a witness early on, \"You must see a lot of action in these towers…\" It's a forecast for the rest of the film, especially its finale in which Belmondo is lowered from a helicopter down to a high-rise window in order to break in. The film's most memorable stunts, however, take place in a surreal chase which brings the two central storylines together. The first half of the sequence is a tense sprint across the rooftops of Paris near Opéra and Galeries Lafayette, in which Letellier hunts the film's main killer after he has claimed another victim. But this chase merges with the hunt for Marcucci after he is spotted driving in another part of the city by one of Letellier's colleagues, leading Letellier to embark on a death-defying race through the Parisian Métro in pursuit of the robber. The first half of this 15-minute sequence alone would be a set piece worthy of any action film. Belmondo has a tendency to run with startling gusto towards the very edge of roofs, sometimes stopping to look down, other times jumping the gap to an adjacent ledge. It was in this part of the chase that the actor genuinely hurt himself, scarring his hand badly after the character misses his jump between the tiled roofs, grabbing a metal gutter à la James Stewart in Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo (1957). The height in this instance is an illusion, with the camera angle hiding a small balcony causeway beneath this particular gap. Still, Belmondo's hand was seriously cut by the gutter. Later, he crashes through the windows of a flat, the falling fake glass also cutting the actor. However, the real death-defying moments take place outside. In one scene, where Letellier loses control of his stepping under gunfire, he slides down a sloping roof. In this brief shot, a safety rope can just be seen around his waist. But rather than taking the viewer out of the drama, it's more likely to shock them as they think, \"Is that it?!\" It seems a paltry safety precaution, and does little to assure the viewer that the actor is really safe, especially as bits of tile come away chaotically with him each time he tries and fails to climb back up. More like this: • Is Tom Cruise the last action hero? • Why stunt people are undervalued in cinema • The French thriller that inspired Psycho If this wasn't enough, the second half of the sequence involves a different kind of danger. Clearly taking cues from William Friedkin's The French Connection (1971) and its own chase scene across New York, Verneuil shoots a pursuit around Paris' Métro system. Unlike Friedkin's scene, in which Gene Hackman's Popeye Doyle is behind a wheel, first following a car, then a train, Verneuil's chase is conducted on foot. As Letellier closes in on Marcucci, he takes ever more risks, to the point where he jumps onto the back of a moving Métro train as it leaves the station, and from there proceeds to climb onto its roof. While several sequences of this scene are evidently filmed in the studio with a projected backdrop, several others are very much real, filmed when the train was travelling at around 35mph (55kmh). Belmondo runs along each carriage rooftop before jumping down flat to avoid the coming tunnels, and then carefully walks across the train roof as it trundles over the Pont de Bir-Hakeim. It's utterly hair-raising. As Eder wrote for The New York Times, \"Perhaps it is an advertisement for the new high-speed Paris subways.\" Just to add to the apparent danger, Belmondo is jumping and scampering around rooftops and trains in less-than-suitable 1970s attire: a wide-lapelled blazer and flared trousers, patent leather penny loafers, and a Rolex Daytona 6263 so valuable that, in 2013, it was sold by his F1 driver son Paul Belmondo at Christie's for €165,000 (£140,000). However, Belmondo was more than prepared for the challenges of the film, having been put through his paces by one of the industry's top stuntman, Rémy Julienne. Julienne had been in the stunt world for some time before Peur sur la ville. He was a specialist in vehicle stunts more than anything else, having been a professional motocross rider. He was Michael Caine's stunt double in Peter Collins' The Italian Job (1969), as he went on to do an array of stunts for the James Bond franchise, starting with John Glen's For Your Eyes Only (1981) and its car chase involving Roger Moore's iconic, disintegrating yellow Citroën 2CV. \"I always like to have an accelerator,\" Julienne once told a French TV show, \"and always brush against the limits\". Julienne worked prolifically throughout the 1970s in French and Italian crime and action cinema as well, and this is when he first met Verneuil and Belmondo. In 1971, Julienne worked with Belmondo and Verneuil on Le casse (The Burglars), which also starred Omar Sharif. It was a testing ground for Belmondo's daring, with several equally gobsmacking stunts including an incredibly aggressive car chase around the cramped streets of Athens and a remarkable stunt in which Belmondo is rolled out of a lorry's tipper down a steep cliff edge followed by an avalanche of debris. It was the beginning of a fruitful working relationship, with Belmondo and Julienne collaborating on 14 other films. Belmondo's technical skill with stunts and his propensity for danger feel more than a little proto-Cruise. At the same time, it's impossible to imagine Cruise agreeing to work under such risky conditions, even if modern health and safety measures allowed him to, a factor which makes Belmondo's stunts even more thrilling. But Cruise is undeniably his closest successor. \"[Belmondo had a] Cruise level of stunt bravery,\" says Bolton. \"He loved police procedurals, action movies and comedies as much as prestige productions, and seemed untrammelled by any expectations or demands. He was, however, resolutely French, always resisting advances from Hollywood, and so his influence is more national than international.\" Verneuil directed only two films with Belmondo after Peur sur la ville , but the spirit of their collaboration lived on in an array of French action policiers. Films such as Georges Lautner's The Professional (1981), and Jacques Deray's Le Marginal (1983) and The Loner (1987), further cemented his position in French popular culture. \"He is forever the insolent young criminal from Breathless,\" Bolton concludes, \"but he definitely came to be one of the biggest, most versatile and enduring stars of French cinema.\" The relationship that really mattered was Belmondo and Julienne's; the stunts they conjured up together defined Bébel's career. Celebrating their collaboration now feels especially apt considering the Academy's recent accepting of stunt work as a creative part of cinema, via its decision to create a new Oscars category starting next year. Julienne and Belmondo would have almost certainly won such an award, had stunt work been acknowledged as an artform in their day. While Belmondo is remembered in some circles today for his arthouse cinema, ultimately it is his daredevilry that cemented him as a cultural institution in France. \"My sense is that his Nouvelle Vague incarnation is one for cinephiles in France,\" says Zagha, \"but that for the majority of French people he was – and remains in the collective memory – a huge star of action films. Those are what made him a monument, a national treasure.\" The post-Peur sur la ville career of this national treasure is best summarised by the film's final exchange. \"Bravo! What you did was marvellous!\" enthuses Letellier's chief (Jean Martin) after the cop has been lowered from a helicopter, smashed into the window of a high-rise block and defeated the serial killer by repeatedly ramming him against a table. \"Nah,\" he quips back. \"No brains, all muscle.\" Belmondo undeniably had both and was one of the most adept actors of his era. But his versatility is rightly remembered as a physical one in the minds of a whole generation of viewers, and his stunts have the power to leave us breathless to this day. -- If you liked this story sign up for The Essential List newsletter, a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

    "title": "'It was the cleverest escape in the prison's 30 years': The men who broke out of Alcatraz with a spoon",
    "content": "On 12 June 1962, three men escaped from Alcatraz, never to be seen again. The ultimate fate of Frank Morris and the Anglin brothers remains a mystery but the ingenuity and determination of their daring escape – from what was the US's most secure prison – continues to captivate. Two years later, the BBC returned to the scene of the crime. In May 1964, BBC Panorama's Michael Charlton made \"the most feared journey in the criminal world\" across the churning waters of San Francisco Bay to see the infamous prison island of Alcatraz. Nicknamed \"the Rock\", the federal penitentiary had held some of the most dangerous criminals in the US. It was regarded as an impregnable fortress. But in the early hours of 12 June 1962, three men achieved what was thought impossible: they escaped. On 4 May, US president Donald Trump said, in a post on his Truth Social site, that he would call for the reopening of Alcatraz, the once-notorious island prison which now serves as a tourist site in the San Francisco Bay. He wrote that it would become \"a symbol of law, order and justice\". Read more by BBC News's Gabriela Pomeroy, here. Alcatraz had originally been a naval defence fort to protect the entrance to the bay. During the US Civil War, because of the island's isolation, steep cliffs and the swift, cold currents that surrounded it, captured Confederate prisoners were held there. Early in the 20th Century it was rebuilt as a military prison. In the 1930s, as the US tried to deal with rampant organised crime that flourished during Prohibition, the Department of Justice took it over. Soon the most fearsome convicts from the federal prison system began arriving. Among its more famous inmates were the notorious gangsters Al Capone, Mickey Cohen and George \"Machine Gun\" Kelly, as well as convicted murderer Robert Stroud, who would later become better known as the \"Birdman of Alcatraz\". \"Men too vicious and troublesome to be held in an ordinary jail,\" was the way the BBC's Charlton put it. Four years before Panorama travelled there, Frank Lee Morris had arrived on the island. Orphaned at the age of 11, and convicted of his first crime by the age of 13, Morris had spent most of his life in and out of various correctional facilities. Considered highly intelligent, he was a seasoned criminal, with a charge sheet ranging from drug possession to armed robbery and, perhaps most notably, prison breaks. He had been sent to the Rock in January 1960 following his escape from Louisiana State Penitentiary. As soon as he arrived on Alcatraz, he began to think about how he would leave. He was joined in his cell block by convicted bank-robbing brothers John and Clarence Anglin and Allen West, who had been an inmate on Alcatraz since 1957. All the men knew each other from previous stints in prisons together, and since they had adjoining jail cells, they were able to speak to each other at night. When the BBC's Charlton visited the site, a year after its closure, he was well aware of the prison's formidable reputation for unrelenting guards, harsh conditions and the punishing sea winds that the convicts had to endure. \"A relentless wind which never seems to stop, howls and echoes through the bars,\" he said. \"Built over the rambling passages of an old fort… the foundations today of Alcatraz are rotting and breaking up.\" With Morris taking the lead, the four prisoners began to concoct an elaborate and audacious plan to escape. Over a period of several months, the men chiselled away at the salt-damaged concrete around the air vent under their sinks. Using metal spoons purloined from the dining hall, a drill made from a vacuum-cleaner motor and discarded saw blades, they dug through to an unguarded utility corridor. To mask the noise of the drill, Morris would play his accordion during the daily hour set aside when music was played to the prisoners. Once they had created a hole large enough to crawl through to the corridor, they climbed up to the empty top level of the cellblock and set up a secret workshop. To hide the cell-wall holes, they fashioned fake papier-mâché grills from prison library magazines. Once they were in their workshop, they set about constructing a 6x14ft makeshift rubber raft and life-vests made from more than 50 stolen raincoats. To seal the rubber, they melted it using the prison's hot steam pipes. They then converted a concertina into a tool to inflate the raft and fashioned paddles out of bits of plywood. But while they worked, they needed to conceal their absence from the guards who periodically made night-time checks. So, they sculpted papier-mâché versions of their heads from soap, toothpaste and toilet paper. To make them look more realistic, they used real hair from the prison barbershop floor and painted them in flesh tones using stolen art supplies. These they would then place in their beds, with bundles of clothes and towels under their blankets in the shape of their bodies to make it look like they were asleep. As they worked on their makeshift escape gear, they were also looking for a way out. Using plumbing piping as steps, they climbed 30 feet (9.1m) and prised open the ventilator at the top of a shaft. They crafted a fake bolt out of soap to keep it in place. More like this: • How D-Day began with a death-defying mission • The US couple who survived the Alaskan wilderness • Britain's mysterious WW2 'island of death' Finally, on the night of 11 June 1962, they were ready to put their ingenious plan into motion. Leaving the dummy heads in their beds to fool the guards, Morris and the two Anglin brothers crawled out through the holes on the cell walls. West's escape was scuppered when he was unable to get out of his cell in time, so the others left without him. They climbed up to the cellhouse roof, ran across it – carrying their makeshift boat, in sight of the guard tower – shimmied down an outside drainpipe, crossed the prison yard, scaled two successive 12-ft (3.7m) barbed wire fences and scrambled down a steep embankment to the north-eastern shore of the island. At the water's edge, they inflated their boat and disappeared into the night. The alarm wasn't raised until the following morning, when the decoy heads were discovered. The island was also home to the families of guards who worked at the prison. Jolene Babyak's father, who was acting warden at Alcatraz at the time, triggered the alarm. \"When I woke up, the siren was still going. It was very piercing, extremely loud, it was horrible, it was pretty scary,\" she told BBC Witness History in 2013. \"I was shocked you know, and my first thought was that can't be an escape attempt, and, of course, it was.\" The prison went into immediate lockdown with an intensive search of all the buildings, including the prison officers' accommodation. Meanwhile Jolene's father launched a massive manhunt with hundreds of law enforcement personnel extensively searching the surrounding area for days. On 14 June, the Coast Guard found one of the prisoners' paddles. The same day, workers found a packet of the Anglins' personal effects, sealed in rubber. Seven days later some remnants of the raft were washed up near the Golden Gate Bridge and the following day one of the homemade life-vests was discovered. But the three fugitives were never seen again.  Although the prisoners escaped the prison, the authorities concluded they must have perished in treacherous waters attempting to leave the island. That was certainly the view of prison warden Richard Willard when the BBC interviewed him in 1964.\" Yes, we are short a few, but they are not bragging about it. In other words, that assumedly all those that we are short, drowned in the procedure. There is, to our knowledge, nobody walking the streets today bragging about having escaped from Alcatraz,\" he said. \"Why am I so sure? You hear the wind, don't you? And you see the water? Do you think you could make it?\" Alcatraz prison shut down in 1963, a year after the men's escape. Partly this was due to its deteriorating structure and the expense of running it but the prison's severe regime had also long been subject of controversy. As early as 1939, US Attorney General Frank Murphy had tried to close it down, saying: \"the whole institution is conducive to psychology that builds up a sinister and vicious attitude among the prisoners\". In History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter. Over the years, prisoners had killed or maimed themselves – unable to face the unrelenting conditions – and as the 1960s progressed, the US looked towards rehabilitation of inmates rather than just their punishment. As for the three escapees, despite no bodies ever being found in the bay, in 1979 they were declared legally dead. The FBI closed its case and turned over responsibility to the US Marshals Service. But speculation about their fate has never waned. The same year they were declared dead, the film Escape from Alcatraz was released with Clint Eastwood portraying Frank Morris. And from the moment of their escape in 1962, there were reports of alleged sightings of the men, and of messages from them.  In 2018, San Francisco police revealed they had been sent a mysterious letter five years earlier, from someone claiming to be John Anglin. The letter read \"I escape from Alcatraz in June 1962. Yes we all made it that night, but barely!\" The letter maintained that the men had lived on in secret, with Frank Morris dying in October 2005, and Clarence Anglin in 2008. The letter's author said he now wanted to negotiate his surrender in exchange for cancer treatment. The FBI assessed the letter but were unable to verify if it was authentic or not. The case is still open for the US Marshals Service. As recently as 2022, it released updated pictures of what the three missing Alcatraz prisoners might look like now, while appealing for any information about them, in the hope that finally it could put the mystery to bed.  This article was originally published on 10 June 2024 and has been republished. -- For more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the In History newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

    "title": "'He swam out to the Russian vessel and was never seen alive again': The Cold War spy mystery of the 'vanishing frogman'",
    "content": "In 1956, Royal Navy Commander \"Buster\" Crabb disappeared in murky circumstances during a visit to the UK by Soviet leader Nikita Khruschev. In 2006, the BBC's Michael Buchanan read the newly declassified files that detailed Crabb's unofficial secret mission – and how the government tried to cover it up. It was on 9 May 1956, 69 years ago this week, that UK Prime Minister Sir Anthony Eden finally succumbed to press pressure and international embarrassment, and ordered an enquiry into the mysterious disappearance of Royal Navy diver Commander Lionel \"Buster\" Crabb. The decorated frogman had vanished during a goodwill visit to the UK by the Soviet leadership at the height of Cold War tensions. When word leaked that Crabb had gone missing, The Admiralty, the government department responsible for the Navy, issued a vague statement that the diver had been testing underwater equipment at Stokes Bay on the Hampshire coast and was presumed drowned. But the story fell apart when the visiting Russians accused their hosts of espionage. The Soviets claimed that they had seen a frogman near the Ordzhonikidze – the ship that had brought the Soviet leader Nikita Khruschev to the UK – while it was docked in Portsmouth Harbour. Despite questions being asked repeatedly in Parliament, Eden refused to say more, claiming: \"It would not be in the public interest to disclose the circumstances in which Commander Crabb is presumed to have met his death.\" The government's stonewalling merely heightened suspicions that Crabb had been on a covert spy mission. Fourteen months after Crabb vanished, a headless, handless body in a diving suit was found by fishermen in Chichester Harbour on the south coast of England. Its lack of fingerprints and teeth made the mutilated body difficult to identify, but a later inquest ruled that it was Crabb. The whole episode publicly embarrassed Eden and wrecked his attempts to develop a more friendly relationship with a post-Stalin Soviet Union.  When he disappeared in 1956, Crabb was well known for his daring underwater exploits. Nicknamed \"Buster\", after the US Olympic swimmer and actor Buster Crabbe, who had risen to fame in the 1930s, he was an expert in underwater bomb disposal. His bravery during World War Two had earned him the George Medal for removing Italian limpet mines from British warships at Malta, and an Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his mine clearance work at Livorno in Italy. His wartime amphibious adventures would later be fictionalised in a 1958 film, The Silent Enemy, with Crabb being played by Laurence Harvey. And even after he was officially demobbed in 1947, he continued diving for the military in various capacities, including investigating sunken submarines. For decades following the frogman's disappearance, the UK government staunchly maintained its silence on the incident. It would only be from 2006 onwards, when due to Freedom of Information requests by the BBC, and classified documents being made public under the 50-year rule, that the murky circumstances of Crabb's ill-fated final dive began to emerge. The declassified files showed that, from the start, the UK's security services were keen to use the opportunity of Khruschev's visit to gather intelligence on their Cold War opponents. They suggested hiding microphones in Claridge's hotel, which the Soviet leadership intended to use as their headquarters during their stay. But the prime minister expressly ruled out the idea and made \"clear that adventures of a similar nature were forbidden\".  Despite this, MI6 recruited Crabb to undertake an \"unofficial enterprise\" to investigate the Russian ship Ordzhonikidze. The exact nature of his mission is still unclear, but the ex-MI5 officer Peter Wright suggested in his book Spycatcher (1987) that it was to examine and photograph the ship's advanced propeller design. In History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter. Two days before the mission, Crabb and another MI6 agent, who went by the name Bernard Smith, checked into the Sally Port hotel in Portsmouth. On the evening of 17 April 1956, Crabb met with a military colleague in a local pub. This colleague, whose name was deleted from the file, was a Royal Navy lieutenant commander who agreed to help Crabb get into Portsmouth Harbour for his final dive. In 2006, the BBC's Michael Buchanan got the chance to examine the previously classified sworn statement by \"the last man to see Crabb alive\". \"He says he was approached by the commander a couple of days before his final dive and asked 'if I would be prepared to assist him, entirely unofficially and in a strictly private capacity, in connection with a dive he was taking a day or two later'. He goes on to say under no account was this man to contact any responsible naval authority,\" said Buchanan. More like this: • The greatest sailing rescue ever made • A death-defying D-Day mission in a wooden glider • The US's most damaging double agent Just before 07:00 on 19 April, the unnamed lieutenant commander went with Crabb to Portsmouth Harbour, and helped him dress and check his equipment. Crabb then swam out to the Russian vessel, and was never seen alive again. The Royal Navy made no attempt to look for the missing frogman for fear of alerting the Ordzhonikidze's crew. \"The documents further reveal that no search and rescue efforts were made for Crabb as it was not a bonafide operation,\" said Buchanan. \"And they detailed the extensive efforts made by [the Admiralty] to ensure they weren't implicated in a botched mission they knew nothing about.\" The intelligence services surmised that Crabb must have either been captured by the Soviets, been destroyed by Russian \"countermeasures\", or suffered a \"natural mishap\". Smith, the MI6 agent, removed Crabb's belongings and checked out of the Sally Port hotel. A few days later, the police removed the pages with their details from the Sally Port's register, which only served to fuel suspicions of a covert mission. Under pressure from MI6 and the government, the Admiralty hastily concocted the spurious story that Crabb had gone missing during a test in Stokes Bay. Records of meetings show the panic at the highest levels of government. Officials feared that if a body was found, the Soviets could use Crabb's death for propaganda purposes. National Archives' Howard Davis told the BBC in 2006 that the file \"makes it perfectly clear that this wasn't an Admiralty operation; they had nothing to do with it and we see them trying to construct a story that they can plausibly tell to face the inevitable questions from the press\". But despite the release of some of the government's classified documents, exactly what happened to the diver that day in 1956 is still unknown. In 1990, Joseph Zwerkin, a former Soviet naval intelligence agent, claimed that a Soviet sniper on the Ordzhonikidze's deck had spotted the diver in the water and shot him. In 2007, a 74-year-old former Russian frogman, Eduard Koltsov, claimed that he slashed Crabb's throat in an underwater fight after catching him attaching a mine to Ordzhonikidze. It has also been suggested that as Crabb was an associate of Sir Anthony Blunt, who was unmasked as a Soviet spy in 1979, he could even have defected. Nicholas Elliott, a former senior MI6 agent who was rumoured to be involved in Crabb's final dive, believed that the 47-year-old diver, who was known for his fondness for whiskey and cigarettes, had succumbed to oxygen poisoning or a heart attack as a result of his exertions while underwater. It may be some time before more details of Crabb's fate come to light. While some papers concerning the affair have been released into the public domain, others have had their classified status extended by the government and are not scheduled for release until 2057. -- For more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the In History newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

    "title": "'Clothes can contain a lot of emotion': How black men have used flamboyant fashion to express pride and resistance",
    "content": "This year's Costume Institute spring exhibition and Met Gala are honouring black \"dandy\" style, and the tradition of bold tailoring worn by black men that has made a statement. Black dandyism, the subject of the Costume Institute's much-anticipated spring 2025 exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Superfine: Tailoring Black Style, is a rich theme. A dandy is a flamboyantly dressed male figure who is concerned not only with looking good but with making a statement about his identity and individuality. And black dandyism is a defiant declaration against confinement, a celebration of black identity, and a movement based around resistance, pride and history. The story of black dandyism does not begin with clothing but with the absence of it. Enslaved Africans, writes Monica L Miller in Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity (2009), \"arrived in America physically and metaphorically naked, a seeming tabula rasa on which European and new American fashions might be imposed\". Dandyism was a critical response to this, and was born out of a desire to self-define and envisage new social and political possibilities – in a context where the very concept of \"blackness\" was created by non-black oppressors. Inspired by Miller's seminal book, the exhibition examines how men's style, and in particular, dandyism, has helped shape transatlantic black identities for more than 300 years. The star-studded Met Gala in New York, which takes place on Monday, takes the corresponding theme \"Tailored for you\" as its dress code. Co-chairing and hosting the event are actor Colman Domingo, Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton, rapper A$AP Rocky and musician and creative director Pharrell Williams. They will work with Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and honorary co-chair, basketball player LeBron James. The show features garments, artworks, photographs and film, and explores 12 different characteristics of dandyism, ranging from Ownership, Heritage and Presence to Respectability, Beauty and Cool. The \"superfine\" in the title, says Miller, who is guest curator of the exhibition, pertains to \"a finely woven wool, which we're using as an expression of luxury, but also feeling 'superfine'\" – a reminder that how you dress can contain \"a lot of emotion\". Indeed, one of slavery's first acts of debasement was to strip the enslaved of their own clothes, and dress them in standard-issue clothing. \"Everyone was supposed to look exactly the same,\" Miller tells the BBC. \"It was a vehicle of dehumanisation, but people immediately affixed buttons, ribbons, modified the garment a little, literally tailored it so that it could be individualised.\" Dandyism was already laying its foundations. In the 17th and 18th Centuries, for enslaved Africans brought back to Europe as domestic servants, control was once again asserted by their masters – in some households they were dressed up in ostentatious, deliberately anachronistic livery, their masters objectifying them in order to signal the family's wealth. Some were educated alongside members of the host family, whose guests were amused to see someone of colour speak and act like a gentleman. However, in the case of Julius Soubise – manumitted (released from slavery) in the 1760s by his British mistress, the Duchess of Queensbury – the joke was on the aristocrats. Soubise reclaimed and exaggerated the flamboyant clothing that his mistress had made him wear by adding diamond-buckled red-heeled shoes, lace frills and clouds of perfume, and his subversive, startlingly feminised dandyism created shockwaves among white society. Educated, witty and charming, and a capable equestrian, fencer and violinist, he destabilised established categorisations of race, gender and class, and forced a reimagining in the white consciousness of what a black man could be. While Soubise used dandyism to assert visibility, elsewhere in the exhibition, dandyism is shown being used for concealment. It was a form of dressing up that enabled William and Ellen Craft to escape slavery in Georgia in 1848, as told in William's 1860 memoir. Transgressing – once again – boundaries of race, gender and class, Ellen, the daughter of an enslaved woman and her slaveholder, disguised herself as a white invalid gentleman – complete with jaw bandage and sling, and green-lensed spectacles – in order to escape her captors, while her husband William was passed off as her servant. When William, with freedom in sight, dandified himself with \"a very good second-hand white beaver [top hat]\" the pair's cover was almost blown, drawing comments from a disgruntled planter that his \"master\" was spoiling him. Their escape succeeded, and the two went on to build a new life across the ocean in England. Later, with the abolition of slavery in 1865, the Crafts were emboldened to move back to the US, while other black Americans began relocating from the rural South to the expanding cities of the North, establishing, for the first time, large black urban communities. One of these was Harlem, New York City, which, during the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 30s, became a centre of creative expression and a manifestation of the black freedom that so many had dreamt of. In forging a modern black identity and standing up against lynchings, riots and persistent discrimination, dressing up again played a central role. In 1917, around 10,000 African Americans took part in the Silent Protest Parade down New York's Fifth Avenue, the men in black tailored suits, the women and children dressed in white. It was a display of respectability, calm and control that contrasted with the savagery of the violence perpetrated against them. The suit, explains Miller, is \"a historical throughline\" in the exhibition, which includes everything \"from livery garments… to tailcoats and different versions of it… to even track suiting\". One of the most dandified examples is the zoot suit, which debuted in Harlem's dance halls in the 1930s before spreading across the country. Donned by performers such as Dizzy Gillespie and Cab Calloway, as well as the activist Malcolm X, it featured oversized shoulder pads, wide lapels and ballooning trousers cuffed at the ankle, and was often accessorised with a pocket watch on a long chain and a brimmed hat. Its sheer voluminosity seemed symbolic of a burgeoning black community's desire to take up their own space and to move with freedom. More like this: • Seven of the best Met Gala looks over the decades • Coachella looks from Lady Gaga to Sabrina Carpenter • The indigenous American supermodel bringing change When rationing was introduced in the 1940s, this expression of counter culture became a source of supposed indignation due to the amount of fabric the zoot required. This became a pretext for further violence against people of colour, particularly in Los Angeles, where white mobs stripped people of their suits and slashed the fabric with knives. But the zoot suit was too strong a signifier of black sartorial elegance to be entirely subdued, and has continued to reassert its importance, reappearing as the trademark style of the musical group Kid Creole and the Coconuts in the 1980s, for example, and later inspiring rapper MC Hammer's iconic baggy-crotched \"Hammer pants\". Described by Anna Wintour (editor-in-chief of US Vogue) in a recent article as \"a dandy among dandies\", André Leon Talley (1948-2022), the first black creative director at US Vogue, was born at the tail end of the zoot suit's reign, and went on to become one of fashion's black luminaries. His favourite photo of himself, taken in the 1980s, appears in the exhibition, along with the panel-checked Morty Sills suit he is wearing. Later, he would become known for his luxurious swooshing capes. \"He understood that, especially as a black man, what you wore told a story about you, about your history, about self-respect,\" writes Wintour. \"For André, getting dressed was an act of autobiography, and also mischief and fantasy, and so much else at once.\" For Nigerian-American artist, photographer and writer Iké Udé, whose self-portrait appears on the cover of Miller's 2009 book, the construction of self through fashion is a critical reaction to negative perceptions of it. \"Whereas the self can be devoured by public scrutiny, it can be saved by private self-objectification,\" he writes in his 1995 essay The Regarded Self. In Sartorial Anarchy #5 (2013), part of a series of self-portraits by Udé, we see a pastiche of dandyism that both embraces this display and satirises it. \"He's wearing male dress in all of those portraits but from different time periods and geographies,\" explains Miller. \"It's a real manifestation of cosmopolitanism and wit.\" This theme of cosmopolitanism continues in the clothing of award-winning designer Foday Dumbuya, whose brand Labrum reflects his own journey from Sierra Leone to Cyprus and England, and features the tagline \"designed by an immigrant\". Much of his work celebrates his African heritage, and uses sharp, sartorial design to challenge negative associations with Africa and with migration. \"He's designing garments that often use immigration documents from his own family or from other people that he incorporates into the printed silk fabric,\" says Miller. The idea for the exhibition began, she adds, with an observation by the curator of the Met's costume collection, Andrew Bolton, \"that there was a kind of renaissance going on in menswear and black designers were really at the forefront of that\". Black dandyism, maintains Miller, is part of a culture in constant movement. \"Black people are always trying to outrun stereotype and appropriation, and if we take it all the way back to the 19th Century, they're trying to outrun capture, so there's a way that that's built into the culture.\" Consequently, dandyism shows no signs of dwindling. \"It's very much related to a jazz riff,\" Miller adds. \"Somebody puts that down, somebody picks that up, modifies it, changes it, it becomes something new…\" Superfine: Tailoring Black Style is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City from 10 May to 26 October 2025.

    "title": "Putin calls for 'direct talks' with Ukraine as European leaders demand ceasefire ",
    "content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has invited Ukraine to take part in \"direct talks\" on 15 May, hours after European leaders urged Moscow to agree to a 30-day ceasefire. In a rare televised late-night address from the Kremlin, Putin said Russia was seeking \"serious negotiations\" aimed at \"moving towards a lasting, strong peace\". Earlier on Saturday, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer travelled to Kyiv with counterparts from France, Germany and Poland to put pressure on Russia to commit to an unconditional ceasefire, starting Monday. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov later said Moscow would \"have to think this through\" - but warned that \"trying to pressure us is quite useless\". In his own statement, Putin said he could \"not rule out\" the possibility that the talks could result in Russia and Ukraine agreeing \"a new truce\". But he did not address calls for a 30-day ceasefire directly. The Russian leader said the proposed talks should be held in the Turkish city of Istanbul, as they have been before, and that he would speak to Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday to discuss the details.  Kyiv has not responded to the invitation. The Ukrainian capital played host on Saturday to Sir Keir, France's Emmanuel Macron, Germany's Friedrich Merz and Poland's Donald Tusk, who form part of the \"coalition of the willing\" - a group of countries committed to supporting Ukraine. Alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, they took part in a joint news conference. The leaders warned that \"new and massive\" sanctions would be imposed on Russia's energy and banking sectors should Putin not agree to the unconditional 30-day ceasefire \"in the air, at sea and on land\". They also said they had discussed the proposal with Donald Trump. Sir Keir later told the BBC the US president was \"absolutely clear\" that their suggestion of an immediate ceasefire was a \"demand that must be met\". After the meeting, Zelensky thanked the assembled leaders for \"standing with\" Ukraine. \"Today we will focus on how to build and guarantee real and lasting security,\" he said. Responding to the proposal, the Kremlin's Peskov said: \"It is a new development. But trying to pressure us is quite useless.\" Russian state media also quoted him as saying that statements from Europe were \"generally confrontational in nature rather than aimed at trying to revive our relations\". Moscow has previously said that before considering a ceasefire, the West must first halt its military aid to Ukraine. Putin later made his own statement, with video showing journalists assembled in a hall inside the Kremlin. \"This would be the first step towards a long-term, lasting peace, rather than a prologue to more armed hostilities after the Ukrainian armed forces get new armaments and personnel, after feverish trench-digging and the establishment of new command posts,\" he said. \"Who needs peace like that?\" Trump described Putin's announcement as a \"potentially great day for Russia and Ukraine\", in a post on Truth Social.  \"It will be a whole new, and much better world,\" he said, adding that he would \"continue to work with both sides to make sure that it happens\". Meanwhile, Putin also accused Ukraine of having repeatedly failed to respond to multiple ceasefire proposals from Moscow, including a 30-day halt in attacks on energy infrastructure and last month's Easter truce. Another ceasefire Putin flagged was one he ordered in April to coincide with World War Two commemorations. It ended on Saturday at midnight local time (21:00 GMT).  Kyiv had rejected the unilateral, three-day ceasefire, calling it a \"theatrical show\". Instead, Zelensky reiterated calls for a longer truce of at least 30 days. While it saw a decrease in fighting, each side accused the other of breaches. On Thursday - the same day the supposed ceasefire took effect - Ukraine accused Russia of more than 730 violations and said it was responding \"appropriately\".  Russia's defence ministry insisted the truce was being observed, before accusing Ukraine of 488 violations. \"In spite of everything, we are offering the Kyiv authorities to resume the negotiations... resume direct talks, and I stress, without any preconditions,\" Putin said on Saturday.  The last direct talks between Moscow and Kyiv took place in 2022, the year Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Copyright 2025 BBC.

    "title": "India and Pakistan accuse each other of 'violations' after ceasefire deal",
    "content": "India and Pakistan have accused each other of \"violations\" hours after the two nations said they had agreed to a ceasefire following days of cross-border military strikes. After sounds of explosions were heard in Indian-administered Kashmir, India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said there had been \"repeated violations of the understanding we arrived at\". A short while later, Pakistan's foreign ministry said it remained \"committed to faithful implementation of a ceasefire...notwithstanding the violations being committed by India in some areas\".  The fighting between India and Pakistan over the last four days has been the worst military confrontation between the two rivals in decades. The use of drones, missiles and artillery started when India struck targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in response to a deadly militant attack in Pahalgam last month. Pakistan had denied any involvement.  After four days of cross-border strikes, India and Pakistan said they had agreed on a full and immediate ceasfire.  US President Donald Trump announced the news on his Truth Social Platform on Saturday morning. He said it had been brokered by the US.  Pakistan's Foreign Minister later confirmed the agreement had been reached by the two countries, adding that \"three dozen countries\" were involved in the diplomacy.  But hours after the announcement, residents - and BBC reporters - in the main Indian-administered Kashmiri cities of Srinagar and Jammu reported hearing the sounds of explosions and seeing flashes in the sky. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said: \"For the last few hours, there have been repeated violations of the understanding we arrived at earlier this evening. \"This is a breach of the understanding arrived at earlier today.\" Misri said India's armed forces was \"giving an appropriate response\" and he concluded his briefing by \"calling upon Pakistan to address these violations\". In response, a spokesman for Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: \"Pakistan remains committed to faithful implementation of ceasefire between Pakistan and India, announced earlier today. \"Notwithstanding the violations being committed by India in some areas, our forces are handling the situation with responsibility and restraint. \"We believe that any issues in smooth implementation of the ceasefire should be addressed through communication at appropriate levels. \"The troops on ground should also exercise restraint.\"  Kashmir is claimed in full by India and Pakistan, but administered only in part by each since they were partitioned following independence from Britain in 1947. It has been a flashpoint between the two nuclear-armed nations and they have fought two wars over it. Confirming the ceasefire, India's external affairs minister S Jaishankar said the two nations had \"worked out an understanding on stoppage of firing and military action\". \"India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It will continue to do so,\" he added.  Later, in an address to the nation, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the ceasefire had been reached \"for the benefit of everybody\". Speaking after the ceasefire announcement, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said India and Pakistan had agreed to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site. He said he and US Vice-President JD Vance had spent 48 hours with senior Indian and Pakistani officials, including their respective Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Shehbaz Sharif. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he welcomed \"all efforts to de-escalate the conflict\". UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Britain has been \"engaged\" in talks for \"some days\", with Foreign Secretary David Lammy speaking to both sides. \"I'm pleased to see today that there's a ceasefire,\" Sir Keir said. \"The task now is to make sure that that is enduring and is lasting.\" The recent fighting came after two weeks of tension following the killing of 26 tourists in the resort town of Pahalgam. Survivors of the 22 April attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, which killed 25 Indians and one Nepali national, said the militants were singling out Hindu men. The Indian defence ministry said its strikes this week were part of a \"commitment\" to hold \"accountable\" those responsible for the attack. Pakistan described them as \"unprovoked\". Pakistan said Indian air strikes and cross-border fire since Wednesday had killed 36 people in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, while India's army reported at least 21 civilians deaths from Pakistani shelling. Fighting intensified overnight on Friday, with both countries accusing each other of targeting airbases and other military sites.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

    "title": "Trump administration considers suspending habeas corpus",
    "content": "Donald Trump's administration is \"actively looking at\" suspending habeas corpus - the right of a person to challenge their detention in court - one of the US president's top aides has said. Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, told reporters on Friday that the US Constitution allowed for the legal liberty to be suspended in times of \"rebellion or invasion\". His comments come as judges have sought to challenge some recent detentions made by the Trump administration in an effort to combat illegal immigration, as well as remove dissenting foreign students. \"A lot of it depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not,\" Miller said.  There are several pending civil cases against the Trump administration's deportation of undocumented migrants based on habeaus corpus.   Most recently, a federal judge ordered the release of a Turkish university student who had been detained for six weeks after writing an article that was critical of Israel. Last week, another judge ordered a Columbia University student detained over his advocacy for Palestinians be released after a petition on habeas corpus grounds. However, other judges have sided with the Trump administration in such disputes. Miller described habeas corpus as a \"privilege\", and said Congress had already passed a law stripping judicial courts of jurisdiction over immigration cases. Legal experts and critics have questioned the veracity of his interpretation of US law. \"Congress has the authority to suspend habeas corpus - not Stephen Miller, not the president,\" Marc Elias, an attorney for the Democratic Party, told MSNBC.  One of Trump's key campaign pledges was to deport millions of immigrants from the US, and his administration has pursued different means of expediting deportations since returning to the White House.  In March, a federal judge's order prevented the Trump administration from invoking a centuries-old wartime law to justify deporting more than 200 Venezuelans, despite the flights going ahead. But deportations have lagged behind detentions - while one person has been deported erroneously. CNN reported, citing unnamed sources, that Trump was personally involved in the discussions around suspending habeas corpus. Trump himself has not mentioned the suspension of habeas corpus, but has said he would take steps to combat injunctions against his actions on deportation.  \"There are ways to mitigate it and there's some very strong ways,\" he said in April.  \"There's one way that's been used by three very highly respected presidents, but we hope we don't have to go that route.\" Habeas corpus - which literally means \"you should have the body\" - allows for a person to be brought before a judge so the legality of their detention can be decided by a judge. The legal right has been suspended four times in US history: during the American Civil War under Abraham Lincoln, in Hawaii following the 1941 Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbour, in the Philippines during US ownership in 1905, and while combat the activities of the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan group in the 19th Century. The section of the US Constitution which includes the suspension of habeas corpus grants its powers to Congress and not the president. Copyright 2025 BBC.

    "title": "Taylor Swift criticises Lively-Baldoni court summons",
    "content": "Taylor Swift's representatives have told the BBC she is being brought into a legal row between Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively to create \"tabloid clickbait\". The 35-year-old singer was summoned to a US court after it was alleged she encouraged Baldoni to accept script re-writes by Lively for It Ends With Us, a film that both starred in and is the centre of a sexual harassment case. Baldoni says he was invited to Lively's New York home in 2023 to discuss script changes, where Lively's husband, Ryan Reynolds, and Swift were there to serve as her \"dragons\".  Representatives for Swift said \"she was not involved in any casting or creative decision\" and \"never saw an edit or made any notes on the film\". Lively, 37, sued Baldoni, 41, in December 2024, accusing him of sexual harassment and a smear campaign. Baldoni is counter-suing Lively and her husband, the actor Ryan Reynolds, on claims of civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy. Lively and Baldoni have been locked in a dispute since the film, which is an adaption of a Colleen Hoover novel, was released last summer. According to Baldoni, there were tensions over the 2023 re-write of the scene, at which he was surprised to find Reynolds and Swift present. He alleges Lively wrote in a text to him: \"If you ever get around to watching Game of Thrones, you'll appreciate that I'm Khaleesi, and like her, I happen to have a few dragons. For better or worse, but usually better. Because my dragons also protect those I fight for.\" Baldoni says he responded supportively, writing: \"I really love what you did. It really does help a lot. Makes it so much more fun and interesting. (And I would have felt that way without Ryan and Taylor).  \"You really are a talent across the board. Really excited and grateful to do this together.\" It is also alleged that Swift was involved in the casting of Isabela Ferrer in the film, who played a younger version of Lively's character, Lily Bloom. Speaking at the New York premiere of It Ends With Us, Ferrer said: \"She [Taylor Swift] was a helpful part of the audition, which I found out later when I got it, and that rocked my world.\" But Swift's representatives said the only involvement she had in the film was permitting the use of her song, My Tears Ricochet, noting that she was among 20 artists featured in the film. Swift \"never set foot on the set of this movie, she was not involved in any casting or creative decisions, she did not score the film, [and] she never saw an edit or made any notes on the film\", they said.  They added that Swift did not see It Ends With Us until \"weeks after its release\" as she was \"travelling around the globe\" on tour at the time. The popstar's spokespeople argued that the subpoena \"designed to use Taylor Swift's name to draw public interest by creating tabloid clickbait instead of focusing on the facts of the case\".

    "title": "Pope Leo prays at tomb of Francis ahead of first Sunday address",
    "content": "Pope Leo XIV will give his first Sunday blessing and address to a crowd in St Peter's Square in the Vatican today. He will recite the Regina Caeli prayer, in honour of the Virgin Mary, in his first public address since his election was announced with white smoke on Thursday. After delivering Sunday mass, Pope Leo will bless those gathered on the square outside - and deliver his reflections. On Saturday, he visited a shrine outside Rome and then prayed before the tomb of his late predecessor Francis inside the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore. Pope Leo will be formally inaugurated at a mass in St Peter's Square next week on 18 May. The Pope was chosen as the new leader of the Catholic Church on Thursday, following a two-day conclave in Vatican City. It has been a busy week for the pontiff, who held his first Mass as Pope in the Sistine chapel on Friday before speaking to cardinals on Saturday. During this meeting, he described himself as an unworthy choice for Pope, and vowed to continue the \"precious legacy\" of his predecessor. He highlighted the importance of missionary work and discussion – as well as care for those he called the \"least and the rejected\". He explained he had chosen the name Leo after a 19th-century Pope known for his teaching on social justice.  The new Pope also suggested the development of artificial intelligence and other advances meant the church was necessary today for the defence of human dignity and justice. He is due to hold an audience with the media on Monday ahead of his inauguration next Sunday.  As part of that mass he will deliver a homily in the presence of numerous heads of state and dignitaries. The 69-year-old is the 267th occupant of the throne of St Peter, and the first American to become a pontiff. He will lead members of the Catholic Church's global community of 1.4bn people. Born Robert Francis Prevost in Chicago, he worked for many years as a missionary in Peru before being made an archbishop there. He also has Peruvian nationality. Although Leo was born in the US, the Vatican described him as the second pope from the Americas. Pope Francis, from Argentina, was the first. Pope Leo is widely seen as a moderate who can offer \"continuity\" and \"unity\" following the death of his predecessor last month.  The new pontiff is believed to have shared Francis' views on migrants, the poor and the environment. In his first speech he told the crowds he wanted \"to walk together with you as a united Church searching all together for peace and justice\". Copyright 2025 BBC.

    "title": "Trump praises 'friendly, constructive' US-China trade talks ",
    "content": "Donald Trump says there has been a \"total reset\" in US-China trade relations following the first day of talks between American and Chinese officials in Switzerland. In a social media post, the US president described the talks as being \"very good\" and said change had been \"negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner\". An escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing has seen the US president hit Chinese imports to the US with tariffs of 145%. China retaliated with levies of 125% on some US goods. Following months of back-and-forth, the two countries are meeting in Geneva this weekend for the first time since Trump hit China with tariffs at the start of the year. Little information beyond the US president's Truth Social post has so far emerged from the talks. They are due to continue on Sunday and are taking place between China's vice-premier He Lifeng and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. \"We want to see, for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business. GREAT PROGRESS MADE!!!\" Trump added. On Friday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Washington would not lower tariffs unilaterally, and China would need to make its own concessions.  Both sides issued various other warnings ahead of the meeting, with Beijing saying the US must ease tariffs while Bessent stressed that the focus was on \"de-escalation\" and this was not a \"big trade deal\". Chinese state media reported that Beijing had decided to engage with the US after fully considering global expectations, the country's interests and appeals from American businesses. Last month, the BBC found that Chinese exporters were struggling with the US's tariffs - one company, Sorbo Technology, reported that half of its products were normally sold to the US and were now sat in boxes in a warehouse in China.  Meanwhile, the US economy was found to have shrank in the first three months of the year - contracting at an annual rate of 0.3% - as firms raced to get goods into the country. The trade war between China and the US intensified last month after President Trump announced a universal baseline tariff on all imports to the United States, on what he called \"Liberation Day\". Around 60 trading partners, which the White House described as the \"worst offenders\", were subjected to higher rates than others. The list included China and the European Union. Trump said this was payback for years worth of unfair trade policies for the US. He also separately announced a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium coming into the US, and a further 25% tariff on all cars and car parts. It was announced last week that the US and UK had agreed a deal, in which the 25% will be cut to 10% for a maximum of 100,000 UK cars - matching the number of cars the UK exported last year. Cars are the UK's biggest export to the US, worth about £9bn last year. Copyright 2025 BBC.

A letter signed by more than 400 British musicians, writers and artists, addressed to Sir Keir Starmer, says failing to give that protection would mean them \"giving away\" their work to tech firms. Also at risk, they write, is \"the UK's position as a creative powerhouse\". They want the PM to back an amendment to the Data (Use and Access) Bill that would require developers to be transparent with copyright owners about using their material to train AI models. A government spokesperson said: \"We want our creative industries and AI companies to flourish, which is why we're consulting on a package of measures that we hope will work for both sectors. \"We're clear that no changes will be considered unless we are completely satisfied they work for creators,\" they added. Other signatories include author Kazuo Ishiguro, playwright David Hare, singers Kate Bush and Robbie Williams, as well as Coldplay, Tom Stoppard and Richard Curtis. Sir Paul McCartney, who told the BBC in January he was concerned about AI ripping off artists, has also signed the letter. \"We are wealth creators, we reflect and promote the national stories, we are the innovators of the future, and AI needs us as much as it needs energy and computer skills,\" it states. They say their concerns can be met if the government backs an amendment proposed by Baroness Beeban Kidron ahead of a key vote in the House of Lords on Monday. Baroness Kidron's amendment, it says, would \"allow both AI developers and creators to develop licensing regimes that will allow for human-created content well into the future.\" Not everyone agrees with the artists' approach. Julia Willemyns, co-founder of the Centre for British Progress think tank, said such proposals could hamper the UK and its bid for growth.  The measures would \"do nothing to stop foreign firms from using content from the British creative industries,\" she told the BBC. \"A restrictive copyright regime would offshore AI development, chill domestic innovation, and directly harm the UK economy,\" she said. However, the letter comes amid mounting concern from artists over the inclusion of their works, and material protected by copyright, in the data used to develop generative AI systems.  These tools, which can produce new content in response to simple text prompts, have become increasingly popular and available to consumers. But their capabilities have been accompanied by concerns and criticism over their data use and energy demand. In February, artists including Annie Lennox and Damon Albarn released a silent album to protest about the government's proposed changes to copyright law. The government carried out a consultation around its proposal to allow developers to be able to use creators' content on the internet to help develop their models, unless the rights holders elect to \"opt out\". According to The Guardian, ministers were reconsidering the proposal following creator backlash. Mr Ishiguro pointed the BBC to an earlier statement in which he wrote, \"why is it just and fair - why is it sensible - to alter our time-honoured copyright laws to advantage mammoth corporations at the expense of individual writers, musicians, film-makers and artists?\" The Nobel Prize-winning author added that since then the only limited advance was that it now appeared the government had accepted the opt-out proposals were not likely to be workable, He thought a new consultation to find a fairer scheme was possible, though it remained to be seen how meaningful any consultation would be. \"It's essential that they get this right,\" he wrote. MPs recently rejected a separate amendment tabled by Baroness Kidron that aimed to make AI developers accountable to UK copyright law. Now, she says transparency obligations for tech firms under the new proposed amendment could support the development of licensing agreements between creators and companies. \"The UK is in a unique position to take its place as a global player in the international AI supply chain, but to grasp that opportunity requires the transparency provided for in my amendments, which are essential to create a vibrant licencing market,\" Baroness Kidron said. In their statement the government said: \"It's vital we take the time to work through the range of responses to our consultation, but equally important that we put in the groundwork now as we consider the next steps.  \"That is why we have committed to publishing a report and economic impact assessment – exploring the broad range of issues and options on all sides of the debate.\" Copyright 2025 BBC.

    "title": "The US and China are finally talking. Why now?",
    "content": "The US-China trade war could be letting up, with the world's two largest economies beginning talks in Switzerland.  Top trade officials from both sides met on Saturday in the first high-level meeting since US President Donald Trump hit China with tariffs in January.  Beijing retaliated immediately and a tense stand-off ensued as the two countries heaped levies on each other. New US tariffs on Chinese imports stand at 145%, and some US exports to China face duties of 125%. There have been weeks of stern, and sometimes fiery, rhetoric where each side sought to paint the other as the more desperate party.  And yet this weekend they face each other over the negotiating table.   So why now? Despite multiple rounds of tit-for-tat tariffs, both sides have been sending signals that they want to break the deadlock. Except it wasn't clear who would blink first.  \"Neither side wants to appear to be backing down,\" said Stephen Olson, senior visiting fellow at Singapore's ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute and a former US trade negotiator.  \"The talks are taking place now because both countries have judged that they can move forward without appearing to have caved in to the other side.\" Still, China's foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian emphasised on Wednesday that \"the talks are being held at the request of the US\".   And the commerce ministry framed it as a favour to Washington, saying it was answering the \"calls of US businesses and consumers\". The Trump administration, however, claims it's Chinese officials who \"want to do business very much\" because \"their economy is collapsing\". \"They said we initiated? Well, I think they ought to go back and study their files,\" Trump said at the White House on Wednesday. But as the talks drew closer, the president struck a more diplomatic note: \"We can all play games. Who made the first call, who didn't make the - it doesn't matter,\" he told reporters on Thursday. \"It only matters what happens in that room.\" The timing is also key for Beijing because it's during Xi's visit to Moscow. He was a guest of honour on Friday at Moscow's Victory Day parade to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the World War Two victory over Nazi Germany.   Xi stood alongside leaders from across the Global South - a reminder to Trump's administration that China not only has other options for trade, but it is also presenting itself as an alternative global leader. This allows Beijing to project strength even as it heads to the negotiating table. Trump insists that the tariffs will make America stronger, and Beijing has vowed to \"fight till the end\"- but the fact is the levies are hurting both countries.  Factory output in China has taken a hit, according to government data. Manufacturing activity in April dipped to the lowest level since December 2023. And a survey by news outlet Caixin this week showed that services activity has reached a seven-month low. The BBC found that Chinese exporters have been reeling from the steep tariffs, with stock piling up in warehouses, even as they strike a defiant note and look for markets beyond the US.  \"I think [China] realises that a deal is better than no deal,\" says Bert Hofman, a professor at the East Asian Institute in National University Singapore.  \"So they've taken a pragmatic view and said, 'OK, well we need to get these talks going.'\" And so with the major May Day holiday in China over, officials in Beijing have decided the time is right to talk. On the other side, the uncertainty caused by tariffs led to the US economy contracting for the first time in three years.  And industries that have long depended on Chinese-made goods are especially worried. A Los Angeles toy company owner told the BBC that they were \"looking at the total implosion of the supply chain\". Trump himself has acknowledged that US consumers will feel the sting. American children may \"have two dolls instead of 30 dolls\", he said at a cabinet meeting this month, \"and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally\".  Trump's approval ratings have also slid over fears of inflation and a possible recession, with more than 60% of Americans saying he was focusing too much on tariffs. \"Both countries are feeling pressure to provide a bit of reassurance to increasingly nervous markets, businesses, and domestic constituencies,\" Mr Olson says.  \"A couple of days of meetings in Geneva will serve that purpose.\" While the talks have been met with optimism, a deal may take a while to materialise. The talks will mostly be about \"touching base\", Mr Hofman said, adding that this could look like an \"exchange of positions\" and, if things go well, \"an agenda [will be] set for future talks\". The negotiations on the whole are expected to take months, much like what happened during Trump's first term. After nearly two years of tit-for-tat tariffs, the US and China signed a \"phase one\" deal in early 2020 to suspend or reduce some levies. Even then, it did not include thornier issues, such as Chinese government subsidies for key industries or a timeline for scrapping the remaining tariffs.  In fact, many of them stayed in place through Joe Biden's presidency, and Trump's latest tariffs add to those older levies.   What could emerge this time is a \"phase one deal on steroids\", Mr Olson said: that is, it would go beyond the earlier deal and try to address flashpoints. There are many, from the illegal fentanyl trade which Washington wants China to crack down harder on to Beijing's relationship with Moscow.  But all of that is far down the line, experts warn.  \"The systemic frictions that bedevil the US-China trade relationship will not be solved any time soon,\" Mr Olson adds. \"Geneva will only produce anodyne statements about 'frank dialogues' and the desire to keep talking.\" Copyright 2025 BBC.

    "title": "How can India and Pakistan find a way to de-escalate?",
    "content": "As the continuing India-Pakistan crisis takes a dangerous turn, nations around the world are urging calm. The initial thinking was that after India launched air strikes, and with Pakistan claiming to have shot down several Indian jets - a claim Delhi has not confirmed - both sides could claim \"victory\" and de-escalate. But there's a danger that any protracted tit-for-tat attacks could lead them to a far more damaging prospect. During past conflicts, such as in 2019 and 2016, it was the United States and a few other global powers that put pressure on Delhi and Islamabad to bring the situation under control and de-escalate. Now passions are running high and the nationalist rhetoric has reached a crescendo on both sides. The neighbours are closer to war than in recent decades. “The World community is keeping quiet; that’s dangerous,” Ayesha Siddiqa, a Pakistani academic who is a senior fellow at King’s College London.  “Though the flare up has been happening for decades, this is the first time the two countries find themselves in a conflict without anyone monitoring them or forcefully telling them to stop,” she said. Unless Washington gets more involved, Islamabad and Delhi may continue with their accusations and counter-accusations. Although US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been telling the senior leaders of India and Pakistan to de-escalate, the message from other American leaders is different. US Vice-President JD Vance has said that a potential war between India and Pakistan would be \"none of our business\" during an interview with Fox News. \"We want this thing to de-escalate as quickly as possible. We can't control these countries, though,\" Vance said. Vance was on a visit to India when the militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, which killed 26 civilians, took place. US President Donald Trump had earlier called rising tension between India and Pakistan a \"shame\". During previous India-Pakistan skirmishes, for example in 2019, tension was defused quickly after India carried out what it called “surgical strikes” on what it called terrorist camps inside Pakistan. One Indian military jet was shot down in the aftermath of the crisis and the pilot was captured by Pakistan. He was released two days later after reported intervention from Washington and other world powers.  But the intensity of the current conflict is different and passions are running high on both sides. While the Trump administration’s priorities are more about tariffs, China and Ukraine-Russia, it may require a concerted attempt by the international community to lower tension between the two nuclear-armed rivals. The other world power which has a stake in South Asia is China. Beijing has close economic and military ties with Islamabad. It has invested more than $50bn (£37.5bn) in Pakistan as parts of its China-Pakistan Economic Corridor to boost trade. China also has unresolved border issues with India and the two countries recently had a border clash in the Himalayan region 2020. Despite the tension, China is the second largest trading partner of India. \"If the US is uninterested [in resolving India-Pakistan tension] then other permanent members of the UN Security Council – P5 - should get involved. It is their responsibility as well,\" Shen Dingli, a Shanghai-based international affairs expert tells the BBC. As India accuses Pakistan of supporting the Kashmiri separatist rebels, who carried out the deadly attack on tourists last month, the Chinese academic says \"the P-5 members can launch a credible investigation into the incident\", to address India's concerns. Gulf states like Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which have close ties to both the countries, could step up their mediation efforts. Saudi Arabian Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Al-Jubeir arrived in Delhi on 7 May in what was seen as a surprise visit amid the backdrop of a spike in tensions between India and Pakistan.  “A good meeting with Adel Al-Jubeir,\" Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said, adding that his counterpart “shared India’s perspective on firmly countering terrorism”. The Saudi minister arrived in Islamabad on Friday for talks with Pakistan's leaders. There are an estimated 2.6 million Pakistanis living and working in the Gulf Kingdom. Riyadh has considerable influence in Pakistan. Saudi Arabia has loaned billions of dollars to Pakistan to bail out the country during economic crises over the years. One way out of the current crisis could be a situation where both sides can claim victory to satisfy their audience. Delhi says the missile strikes on suspected militant hideouts inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir were part of a commitment to hold “accountable” those responsible for the last month’s attack in Pahalgam.  “India has already said it has achieved its objectives. Now, the ball is in Pakistan’s court. If they wish to retaliate then that would elicit a strong response from India,” retired Indian Lt Gen D S Hooda said.  For Pakistan, especially for its powerful military, it would want to show its people that it can stand up against India and teach it a lesson once again by downing five of the Indian air force jets during a dog fight.  India has not acknowledged the loss of any of its fighter jets in the current skirmish. But according to Pakistani academic Siddiqa, how the current crisis ends depends on what India’s stated objectives are. “India’s goal posts keep changing day by day – from punishing Pakistan to attaining something more,” she said.

    "title": "Xi shows he wants to be close to Putin - but not too close",
    "content": "Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin make it look like they're the best of friends. Xi took his place at the right-hand side of Putin, the position of a steadfast ally, as their troops marched together on Red Square as part of Moscow's Victory Day parade. Hours earlier, Xi described the bond between the two countries as \"unbreakable\" and added that Russia and China should be \"friends of steel\". This is Xi's 11th visit to Russia since becoming president in 2013 and the two leaders have met on more than 40 occasions.  Putin has already announced plans to visit China in the autumn and the two leaders have even, in the past, shared a rare public hug. But there is more to this relationship than meets the eye. \"We see a lot of exchanges between the two men and patriotic displays of togetherness,\" said Mathieu Boulegue, from the Center for European Policy Analysis. \"They can be friends on one end or co-operating on one end and then ripping each other apart on others, and actually be competitors in certain aspects of their relationship. \"We get wowed by the symbolism. There's a lot of performance around this relationship. But it's interesting to look at the real substance.\" In truth, President Xi is walking a very fine line. Russia is an important partner for China but Putin's invasion of Ukraine has made him an international pariah in much of the world. Beijing needs to be careful that its friendship with Moscow doesn't isolate other prospective partners, especially as it is fighting an economic war with the United States. China has been courting Europe for several months and stepped up its campaign after Donald Trump became US president. Beijing has been keen to portray itself as a stable alternative global partner in contrast to an unpredictable White House in Washington. There were some signs earlier this week that these diplomatic overtures were working. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, and António Costa, the president of the European Council, exchanged messages on Tuesday with President Xi and Chinese Premier Li Qiang to celebrate the 50th anniversary of bilateral relations. The stumbling block of any prospective partnership has been Beijing's close-knit relationship with Moscow and its economic support for Russia. China has not condemned its \"old friend\" for the invasion and instead calls for an end to the \"crisis\". If President Xi appears to stand too close to Putin, it could cause friction with Europe at a time when it is looking for friendship. But the Chinese leader has another key message to send. Trump's initial attempts to end the war in Ukraine had him touting his close personal relationship with Putin. It prompted analysts to ask if Washington was trying to drive a wedge between Moscow and Beijing. Xi will want to make it clear to Trump this is not possible. \"Together, we must foil all schemes to disrupt or undermine our bonds of amity and trust,\" Xi wrote in a signed article for Russian media.  The Russian and Chinese leaders also described Trump's plans for a \"Golden Dome\" missile defence shield over the US as \"deeply destabilising\", and argued that it would weaponise space. Both leaders are keen to present their vision of an alternative world order in the face of what they believe is US hegemony. But Xi will be aware that while China is a superpower – Russia's power is now limited. This is no longer a partnership of equals. The war in Ukraine has weakened Russia's economy and depleted its arsenal and army.  Western sanctions have also left Moscow far more reliant on Beijing for economic survival. They have severely weakened the Kremlin on the world stage. \"Russia needs China much more than the opposite is true,\" Boulegue said.  Moscow will need to \"suck it up\", he added. Putin may lean into his friend as they watch the tanks roll through Red Square and they can team up when they need each other. But behind the bold statements, the smiles, handshakes and the occasional hug, there are potential sources of discord and disharmony which could surface in the years to come. Copyright 2025 BBC.

    "title": "The first drone war opens a new chapter in India-Pakistan conflict",
    "content": "The world's first drone war between nuclear-armed neighbours has erupted in South Asia. On Thursday, India accused Pakistan of launching waves of drones and missiles at three military bases in Indian territory and Indian-administered Kashmir - an allegation Islamabad swiftly denied. Pakistan claimed it had shot down 25 Indian drones in recent hours. Delhi remained publicly silent. Experts say the tit-for-tat attacks mark a dangerous new phase in the decades-old rivalry, as both sides exchange not just artillery but unmanned weapons across a volatile border. As Washington and other global powers urge restraint, the region is teetering on the edge of escalation, with drones -  silent, remote and deniable - opening a new chapter in the India-Pakistan conflict. \"The Indo-Pak conflict is moving into a new drone era - one where 'invisible eyes' and unmanned precision may determine escalation or restraint. Thus, in South Asia's contested skies, the side that masters drone warfare won't just see the battlefield - they'll shape it,\" Jahara Matisek, a professor at the US Naval War College, told the BBC. Since Wednesday morning, Pakistan says Indian air strikes and cross-border fire have killed 36 people and injured 57 more in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. On the other side, India's army reports at least 16 civilians dead from Pakistani shelling. India insists its missile barrage was retaliation for a deadly militant attack on Indian tourists in Pahalgam last month - an attack Islamabad denies any role in. Pakistan's military announced on Thursday that it had shot down 25 Indian drones across various cities, including Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi. The drones - reportedly Israeli-made Harop drones - were reportedly intercepted using both technical and weapon-based countermeasures. India claimed to have neutralised several Pakistani air defence radars and systems, including one in Lahore, which Islamabad denied.   Laser-guided missiles and bombs, drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become pivotal in modern warfare, significantly enhancing the precision and efficiency of military operations. These can relay co-ordinates for airstrikes or, if equipped, directly laser-designate targets, and help immediate engagement.  Drones can be used as decoys or suppression of enemy air defences, flying into contested airspace to trigger enemy radar emissions, which can then be targeted by other munitions like loitering drones or anti-radiation missiles. \"This is how Ukraine and Russia both do it in their war. This dual role - targeting and triggering - makes drones a force multiplier in degrading enemy air defences without risking manned aircraft,\" says Prof Matisek. Experts say India's drone fleet is largely built around Israeli-made reconnaissance UAVs like the IAI Searcher and Heron, along with Harpy and Harop loitering munitions - drones that double as missiles, capable of autonomous reconnaissance and precision strikes. The Harop, in particular, signals a shift toward high-value, precision-targeted warfare, reflecting the growing importance of loitering munitions in modern conflict, experts say. The Heron, say experts, is India's \"high-altitude eyes in the sky\" for both peacetime monitoring and combat operations. The IAI Searcher Mk II is designed for frontline operations, offering up to 18 hours of endurance, a range of 300km (186 miles), and a service ceiling of 7,000m (23,000ft).  While many believe India's combat drone numbers remain \"modest\", a recent $4bn deal to acquire 31 MQ-9B Predator drones - which can can fly for 40 hours and up to an altitude of 40,000ft - from the US marks a major leap in its strike capabilities.  India is also developing swarm drone tactics - deploying large numbers of smaller UAVs to overwhelm and saturate air defences, allowing higher-value assets to penetrate, say experts. Pakistan's drone fleet is \"extensive and diverse\", comprising both indigenous and imported systems, Ejaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst told the BBC. He said the inventory includes \"over a thousand drones\", featuring models from China, Turkey and domestic manufacturers. Notable platforms include the Chinese CH-4, the Turkish Bayraktar Akinci, and Pakistan's own Burraq and Shahpar drones. Additionally, Pakistan has developed loitering munitions, enhancing its strike capabilities.  Mr Haider said the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) has been actively integrating unmanned systems into its operations for nearly a decade. A key focus is the development of \"loyal wingman\" drones - unmanned aerial vehicles designed to operate in co-ordination with manned aircraft, he added. Prof Matisek believes \"Israel's technical assistance, supplying Harop and Heron drones, has been pivotal for India, while Pakistan's reliance on Turkish and Chinese platforms highlights an ongoing arms race\". While the recent drone exchanges between India and Pakistan mark a significant escalation in their rivalry, they differ markedly from the drone-centric warfare observed in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, experts say. There, drones become central to military operations, with both sides deploying thousands of UAVs for surveillance, targeting and direct attacks. \"Deploying drones [in the ongoing conflict] instead of fighter jets or heavy missiles represents a lower-level military option. Drones are less heavily armed than manned aircraft, so in one sense, this is a restrained move. However, if this is merely a prelude to a broader aerial campaign, the calculus changes entirely,\" Manoj Joshi, an Indian defence analyst, told the BBC. Ejaz Haider believes the recent drone activity in Jammu \"appears to be a tactical response to immediate provocations, not a full-scale retaliation [by Pakistan]\".  \"A true retaliatory strike against India would involve shock and awe. It would likely be more comprehensive, involving multiple platforms - both manned and unmanned - and targeting a broader range of objectives. Such an operation would aim to deliver a decisive impact, signalling a significant escalation beyond the current tit-for-tat exchanges,\" Mr Haider says.  While drones have fundamentally reshaped the battlefield in Ukraine, their role in the India-Pakistan conflict remains more limited and symbolic, say experts. Both countries are using their manned air forces to fire missiles at one another as well. \"The drone warfare we're witnessing may not last long; it could be just the beginning of a larger conflict,\" says Mr Joshi. \"This could either signal a de-escalation or an escalation - both possibilities are on the table. We're at an inflection point; the direction we take from here is uncertain.\" Clearly India is integrating drones into its precision-strike doctrine, enabling stand-off targeting without crossing borders with manned aircraft. However, this evolution also raises critical questions. \"Drones lower the political and operational threshold for action, providing options to surveil and strike while trying to reduce escalation risks,\" says Prof Matisek. \"But they also create new escalation dynamics: every drone shot down, every radar blinded, becomes a potential flashpoint in this tense environment between two nuclear powers.\"  Copyright 2025 BBC.

    "title": "Trump proposes 80% China tariff ahead of trade talks ",
    "content": "US President Donald Trump has proposed cutting tariffs on goods from China, in his latest comment to signal interest in de-escalating the trade war between the world's two biggest economies.  \"80% Tariff on China seems right,\" Trump wrote on social media on Friday, ahead of trade talks between the two countries in Switzerland.  China's Vice Foreign Minister Hua Chunying also struck a confident note ahead of the meetings, saying Beijing had \"full confidence\" in its ability to manage trade issues with the US. Since returning to the White House, Trump has hit Chinese imports with 145% tariffs and China has retaliated with levies of 125% on some US goods, driving down trade between the two nations. On Friday, official figures for April showed China's exports to the US fell by more than 20% compared to a year earlier. But at the same time its total exports rose by a better-than-expected 8.1%. Officials in both Washington and Beijing are \"under growing economic pressure\", Dan Wang from political risk consultancy Eurasia Group told the BBC. \"The recent signals from both sides suggest a transactional de-escalation is on the table\", she added. The announcement earlier this week of the talks was welcomed as an important first step towards easing tensions but analysts have warned that this marks the start of what are likely to be lengthy negotiations. \"The systemic frictions between the US and China will not be resolved any time soon,\" said former US trade negotiator, Stephen Olson. Any cuts to tariffs as a result of this meeting are likely to be \"minor\", he added. The initial negotiations will be led by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China's Vice Premier and economic tsar He Lifeng. But \"I think everyone recognises that any final deal will require the active engagement of both presidents,\" Mr Olson said.  Another trade expert said that even if the new tariffs imposed by Trump were lifted, the two countries would still have major issues to overcome. \"A realistic goal is probably at best a pullback from the sky-high bilateral tariffs but that would still leave in place high tariff barriers and various other restrictions\", the former head of the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) China division, Eswar Prasad told BBC News. On social media on Friday, Trump called on China to \"open up its market\" to the US. He said any tariff reduction would be \"up to Scott B\".  In earlier remarks on Thursday, he had said he expected a \"very friendly\" meeting.  The talks between China and the US are set to take place just two days after the UK became the first country to strike a tariffs deal with the Trump administration.  The US agreed to reduce import taxes on a set number of British cars and allow some steel and aluminium into the country tariff-free, in exchange for new access to US beef and other exports, according to an outline of the new agreement. Countries around the world are scrambling to make similar deals before steep US import taxes are due to take effect next month. Trump announced what he called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on dozens of countries in April but paused them shortly afterwards for 90 days to give their governments time to negotiate with his administration. Businesses based in the US will also be watching events in Switzerland closely. Wild Rye, a women's outdoor clothing firm based in the state of Idaho, has manufacturing stations in China and has been severely affected by the tariffs.  The cost of shipping goods has jumped significantly, the firm's chief executive, Cassie Abel, told the BBC's Today programme. \"We have a purchase order that's incoming, which is around $700,000 [of goods] that's now costing £1.2m in levies up from £200,000,\" she said.  Ms Abel added she was now looking to sell parts of her business to try to raise cash.

    "title": "India reports strikes on military bases, Pakistan denies any role",
    "content": "India has accused Pakistan of attacking three of its military bases with drones and missiles, a claim which has been denied by Islamabad. The Indian Army said it had foiled Pakistan's attempts to attack its bases in Jammu and Udhampur, in Indian-administered Kashmir, and Pathankot, in India's Punjab state. Blasts were reported on Thursday evening in Jammu city in Indian-administered Kashmir as the region went into a blackout. Pakistan's defence minister told the BBC they were not behind the attack. \"We deny it, we have not mounted anything so far,\" Khawaja Asif told the BBC, adding: \"We will not strike and then deny\". Earlier on Thursday, India said it had struck Pakistan's air defences and \"neutralised\" Islamabad's attempts to hit military targets in India on Wednesday night. Pakistan called that action another \"act of aggression\", following Indian missile strikes on Wednesday on targets in Pakistan and Pakistani-administered Kashmir. India's strikes on Wednesday sparked a chorus of calls for de-escalation from the international community with the UN and world leaders calling for calm.  The attacks and incidents of shelling along the border have fanned fears of wider conflict erupting between the nuclear-armed states. It is being viewed as the worst confrontation between the two countries in more than two decades. India said it hit nine \"terrorist infrastructure\" sites on Wednesday in retaliation for  a militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month. Pakistan has strongly denied Indian claims that it backed the militants who killed 26 civilians in the mountainous town of Pahalgam. It was the bloodiest attack on civilians in the region for years, sending tensions soaring. Most of the victims were Indian tourists. Indian-administered Kashmir has seen a decades-long insurgency against Indian rule which has claimed thousands of lives. Kashmir has been a flashpoint between the countries since they became independent after British India was partitioned in 1947. Both claim Kashmir and have fought two wars over it. There were calls for restraint from around the world after India launched \"Operation Sindoor\" early on Wednesday.   But on Thursday both sides accused each other of further military action. Pakistan's military spokesman said drones sent by India had been engaged in multiple locations. \"Last night, India showed another act of aggression by sending drones to multiple locations,\" Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said. \"These locations are Lahore, Gujranwala, Chakwal, Rawalpindi, Attock, Bahawalpur, Miano, Chor and near Karachi.\" He said one civilian had been killed in Sindh province and four troops injured in Lahore. The US consulate in Lahore told its staff to shelter in the building.  India said its latest action had been taken in response to Pakistan's attempts to \"engage a number of military targets in northern and western India\" overnight. \"It has been reliably learnt that an Air Defence system at Lahore has been neutralised,\" a Defence Ministry statement said. Pakistan denied the claim. There was no independent confirmation of the two countries' versions of events. Later in the day India's foreign secretary Vikram Misri told a news conference in Delhi: \"Our intention has not been to escalate matters, we are only responding to the original escalation.\" Meanwhile, casualty numbers continue to rise. Pakistan says 31 people have been killed and 57 injured by Indian air strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and firing along the Line of Control, since Wednesday morning. India's army said the number of people killed by Pakistani firing in the disputed Kashmir region had risen to 16, including three women and five children. India initially did not name any group it believed was behind the attack in Pahalgam but on 7 May it accused the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group of carrying it out. Indian police have alleged that two of the attackers were Pakistani nationals, a claim denied by Islamabad. It says it has nothing to do with the 22 April attacks. In a late-night address on Wednesday, Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif vowed to avenge those killed in India's strikes. He repeated Pakistan's claim that it had shot down five Indian fighter jets, saying that was a \"crushing response\". India has not commented on that claim. Following the reports of Thursday's explosions in Jammu, local media cited Indian military sources on Thursday in reporting that blasts across the Jammu region were also reported in the towns of  Akhnoor, Samba and Kathua.

    "title": "Dyer continued rehab after letter from daughter",
    "content": "Danny Dyer has said receiving a letter from his daughter Dani while at a rehab facility in 2016 was what convinced him to continue his treatment.  Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, the actor said he'd \"had enough\" of the treatment he'd received and was \"going to go\". \"Then they read a letter out from home, from my daughter Dani, and it made me sit back down in that seat,\" he told presenter Lauren Laverne. Whilst he did not share what his then 20-year-old daughter had written, he said he \"grew up and understood this is my life and fame and all that stuff is toxic\".  Dyer said the letter from Dani made him reflect on the pain he'd caused his family and commit to continuing his treatment at the facility in South Africa. Dani Dyer shot to fame on Love Island, winning the 2018 series. She and her father have since appeared together on Celebrity Gogglebox, an Italian travel series, and on their podcast Sorted With The Dyers.  Danny Dyer, who shot to fame in the 1999 film Human Traffic, has gone on to become one of the most recognisable stars of British TV and film. In his interview, the 47-year-old spoke about how fame has affected his personal life, leading him to make \"a lot of bad decisions\". He said at one stage of his career, he was \"doing a lot of drugs\". \"I'd go to nightclubs and DJ sometimes but in general just wave off of balconies and I'd get paid quite a lot of money to do it,\" he added. Dyer says looking back is \"awful\" and that his days of \"hedonism\" and \"mad behaviour\" are over. He said one of his turning points came in 2013, when he was offered the role of Queen Vic landlord Mick Carter in EastEnders, which he says he took because he \"had no money\". \"I had bailiffs [coming round], no-one would hire me and the more I'm doing these club appearances, the more drugs I'm taking, and drink, so I'm in this weird spiral.\" Four years later, he made the decision to go to rehab in Cape Town during an awards show after-party at his house. \"I remember I had this moment where I was sitting in my ensuite trying to work out how to put a pair of jeans on - I was that off my head. \"I looked up, I looked at my wife and I could just see how tired she looked and I could hear kids running around downstairs, and I thought 'I need to sort my life out',\" he added. Dyer says it made him realise how addiction \"affects so many people around you, not just yourself\". Dyer, who is nominated for best male comedy performance at Sunday's Bafta TV Awards for his role in Mr. Bigstuff, has also experienced success with Disney hit Rivals this year. He said a lot of the work he took in the early stages of his career was due to the lack of money he had and the added pressure of becoming a first-time parent with his now-wife Joanne at the age of 19. \"I'd made a few films but I just wasn't getting paid any money and I was desperate to get on the property ladder,\" he said. \"I was still living on a council estate with my daughter and Jo.\" Dyer says he then got offered a documentary series in 2006 called The Real Football Factories and \"couldn't believe the money that was offered to me\". \"I can't watch them back now [the documentaries], I cringe at them, but I needed to earn money, I needed to get a house and I needed to do the right thing,\" he added. You can listen to Danny Dyer's episode of Desert Island Discs on BBC Radio 4 at 10:00 on Sunday. Alternatively, an edited version of the show will be available on BBC Sounds after it has been broadcast. Copyright 2025 BBC.

    "title": "Baby Reindeer and Mr Bates to compete at TV Baftas",
    "content": "Baby Reindeer and Mr Bates vs the Post Office will go head to head at the Bafta TV Awards, which take place later at London's Royal Festival Hall. The event is one of the most prestigious in the TV calendar, and will see shows broadcast in 2024 compete for awards voted for by the British Academy. First screened by ITV in January 2024, Mr Bates vs the Post Office was one of the most impactful shows of the year and led to widespread public outcry about the wrongful convictions of hundreds of sub-postmasters. Baby Reindeer, meanwhile, was a breakout viral hit for Netflix about an aspiring comedian and his stalker, but it also prompted a defamation claim from the woman said to have inspired it.  The TV Baftas mark the final stop on the awards circuit for both shows, after wins at other events such as the Emmys, Golden Globes, SAG and National Television Awards. Scroll down for the nominations list in full The above tallies include nominations for the memorable moment prize, the only award voted by the public. The numbers do not include the shows' earlier nominations and wins at the Bafta Craft Awards, which took place last month and saw Baby Reindeer's Richard Gadd take home best comedy writing, with Slow Horses and Inside No. 9 among the other winners. The Post Office scandal is widely considered the biggest miscarriage of justice in modern British history, and saw hundreds of sub-postmasters wrongly prosecuted and convicted of crimes they didn't commit, based on inaccurate data from the Horizon software system. The story was reported in the media over several years, but ITV dramatisation Mr Bates vs the Post Office brought it a new league of public attention and prompted the government to announce new legislation to exonerate and compensate victims. Meanwhile, Baby Reindeer told the story of a struggling stand-up comedian, the woman who stalks him, and the powerful man in the TV industry who mentors and then sexually assaults him. Richard Gadd's partly autobiographical drama became one of the most dissected series of the year. Other nominees include Rivals, a Disney+ adaptation of a Jilly Cooper novel about two powerful men battling for control of a local TV network, and Slow Horses, about a dysfunctional unit within MI5 made up of disgraced agents. Say Nothing, which followed the lives of those growing up during the troubles in Belfast, is also nominated, alongside Mr Loverman, a screen adaptation of Bernadine Evaristo's novel about an elderly man whose marriage falls apart after his long-term affair with his male friend is revealed. Sherwood focused on a Nottinghamshire community still reeling from the 1980s miners' strike, while Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light continued Hilary Mantel's trilogy about Thomas Cromwell's continued rise to power and eventual fall from grace.  Other nominees include reality series The Traitors, a game of deception played in a Scottish castle, and Gavin & Stacey: The Finale, which saw the long-running series about two families from from Billericay in Essex and Barry in Wales reach an emotional conclusion.  Actor and TV presenter Alan Cumming will take over hosting duties this year, and we hope he brings just as much drama as he did to the latest cracking series of The Traitors US.  The Scottish star's film credits include Eyes Wide Shut, GoldenEye and Emma, as well as two absolute masterpieces of 1990s cinema - Spice World: The Movie and Romy and Michele's High School Reunion. Bafta's executive director of awards and content, Emma Baehr, said Cumming would \"definitely bring a playful sense of mischief and fun to the ceremony\". Elsewhere in the ceremony, Jessie J will deliver her first TV performance in six years, singing the appropriately titled The Award Goes To, while Tom Grennan will perform his new single Full Attention. Awards will be presented by stars including Dame Mary Berry, Billy Porter, Suranne Jones, Ashley Walters, Katie Piper, Sir David Suchet, Big Zuu, Ellie Simmonds, Owen Cooper, Rose Ayling Ellis, Stacey Dooley and Baroness Benjamin. The ceremony will be broadcast on BBC One at 19:00 BST. But it actually takes place a couple of hours earlier, so that some sections of the ceremony can be edited down before the show airs. BBC News will be running spoiler-free coverage, with winners revealed on our live page in line with when they are announced on BBC One.

    "title": "How to win Eurovision, according to the experts",
    "content": "The Eurovision Song Contest was watched by around 163 million people last year – meaning there are potentially 163 million different opinions on what makes a perfect entrant. Do you go for a soulful ballad, guaranteed to leave Europe misty-eyed and full of love and peace? Or do you opt for a cheesy extravaganza, complete with saucy takes on regional costumes and eye-popping staging that will have the entire continent (and Australia) raving in their living rooms? Forensic musicologist at Boston's Berklee College of Music Joe Bennett has analysed hundreds of Eurovision finalists, identifying two dominant musical styles. One is the \"Euro-banger\" - high-energy, 120+ BPM songs with kick drums and synth-heavy production, like Sweden's winning entries Euphoria (Loreen, 2012) and Heroes (Måns Zelmerlöw, 2015). The other is the slow-burning ballad - typically around 70 BPM, such as Portugal's Amar Pelos Dois (Salvador Sobral, 2017) and the Netherlands' Arcade (Duncan Laurence, 2019). There is a cliché that Eurovision songs are only about love and peace – reinforced by a song performed during the 2016 contest's interval about writing a perfect Eurovision song, called Love Love Peace Peace. According to Bennett, there is some validity to this, with every Eurovision song falling under six broad lyrical themes: \"love, unity, self-assertion, partying, history and songs about making music\". He adds that \"songs of self-assertion or lyrical self-empowerment do very well\" - as seen with Austria's 2014 winner Rise Like a Phoenix (Conchita Wurst). Acts might be tempted to go over the top on staging, but this may not be the way to secure victory, according to our experts. Songwriter Thomas Stengaard co-wrote Denmark's 2013 winner Only Teardrops (as well as this year's UK entry What the Hell Just Happened by Remember Monday). He puts his success down, in part, to its simple staging, which he says made it easy to remember. \"If you asked a kid to draw that staging, they could. It was a girl with no shoes on, two guys playing the drums and a flute guy. Very simple, but it worked.\" Vocal coach Carrie Grant, who led the UK's jury in 2014 and came sixth in the contest as part of Sweet Dreams in 1983, agrees. \"There is nothing worse than having an artist whose stage has lots of money but their performance doesn't warrant it,\" she says. \"It makes that performance seem worse.\" The 2014 winner (and Carrie's personal favourite) was Conchita Wurst – the first act to win the contest without backing singers or dancers on stage since 1970. What made Conchita stand out was that she was a bearded drag queen. Carrie believes Eurovision fans love things that are quirky and that \"embrace the LGBT community\". But she adds that Conchita wasn't a gimmick but instead \"a brilliant singer who could deliver what we call in vocal coaching 'money moments'\". Minor-key songs increasingly dominate Eurovision. Bennett debunks the idea that \"major equals happy, minor equals sad\", adding that \"minor keys are more a shorthand for emotional depth\". In 2023, 85% of finalists performed in minor keys, according to the Press Association. In the last 20 years, only two major-key songs have won - 2011's Running Scared (for Azerbaijan) and 2017's Amar Pelos Dois. Professor Elizabeth Hellmuth Margulis, a researcher in music cognition at Princeton, highlights source sensitivity – our instinct to associate a song's sound with its intended context. A few bars of a techno song, for example, and we have a mental image of a dark nightclub, and of the sort of DJ who might perform there. This means certain minor keys now immediately signal \"Eurovision-ness\" to audiences. Remember Monday's What the Hell Just Happened was written at a songwriting camp, with multiple songwriters working together at a countryside retreat to write the perfect song for this year's UK act. The song was intentionally written in a major key to stand out in a sea of minor-key songs - similar to the UK's 2022 second-place entry, Spaceman by Sam Ryder (B Major). Repetition is important to make a song stick in the mind, says Margulis. But songs should avoid being too repetitive. Margulis says that what particularly makes a song catchy is \"not only when they are heard repeatedly, but also when they throw in some kind of surprise twist\". Bucks Fizz's 1981 winner for the UK, Making Your Mind Up, is a classic example. First, the song changes key, quickly followed by a memorable costume change in which the female singers' skirts were ripped off to reveal shorter skirts – a joint visual and musical twist. Earlier Eurovision winners were often mocked for their nonsense lyrics, like Sweden's 1984 winner Diggi-Loo Diggi-Ley, but Bennett argues this highlights Eurovision's strong focus on melody. \"Eurovision really needs big melodic hooks. You want people across Europe to be singing that melody. The need for a very accessible, catchy chorus is essential.\" Key changes have long been a way to introduce novelty into Eurovision songs. The 2000s saw multiple winners follow this formula, including Olsen Brothers' Fly on the Wings of Love for Norway (2000), and Serbia's Molitva in 2007. But as Bennett points out, though they are still present in around a fifth of finalists, no song with a final chorus key change has won since Molitva almost 20 years ago. Stengaard's song for this year's UK act Remember Monday is certainly full of surprises. BBC music correspondent Mark Savage said the song featured \"a dizzying array of key changes and tempo shifts\". The song is the songwriter's answer to the question he asks himself whenever he writes for Eurovision: \"How do you stand out in a contest where everyone wants to stand out?\" Copyright 2025 BBC.

    "title": "Taylor Swift criticises Lively-Baldoni court summons",
    "content": "Taylor Swift's representatives have told the BBC she is being brought into a legal row between Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively to create \"tabloid clickbait\". The 35-year-old singer was summoned to a US court after it was alleged she encouraged Baldoni to accept script re-writes by Lively for It Ends With Us, a film that both starred in and is the centre of a sexual harassment case. Baldoni says he was invited to Lively's New York home in 2023 to discuss script changes, where Lively's husband, Ryan Reynolds, and Swift were there to serve as her \"dragons\".  Representatives for Swift said \"she was not involved in any casting or creative decision\" and \"never saw an edit or made any notes on the film\". Lively, 37, sued Baldoni, 41, in December 2024, accusing him of sexual harassment and a smear campaign. Baldoni is counter-suing Lively and her husband, the actor Ryan Reynolds, on claims of civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy. Lively and Baldoni have been locked in a dispute since the film, which is an adaption of a Colleen Hoover novel, was released last summer. According to Baldoni, there were tensions over the 2023 re-write of the scene, at which he was surprised to find Reynolds and Swift present. He alleges Lively wrote in a text to him: \"If you ever get around to watching Game of Thrones, you'll appreciate that I'm Khaleesi, and like her, I happen to have a few dragons. For better or worse, but usually better. Because my dragons also protect those I fight for.\" Baldoni says he responded supportively, writing: \"I really love what you did. It really does help a lot. Makes it so much more fun and interesting. (And I would have felt that way without Ryan and Taylor).  \"You really are a talent across the board. Really excited and grateful to do this together.\" It is also alleged that Swift was involved in the casting of Isabela Ferrer in the film, who played a younger version of Lively's character, Lily Bloom. Speaking at the New York premiere of It Ends With Us, Ferrer said: \"She [Taylor Swift] was a helpful part of the audition, which I found out later when I got it, and that rocked my world.\" But Swift's representatives said the only involvement she had in the film was permitting the use of her song, My Tears Ricochet, noting that she was among 20 artists featured in the film. Swift \"never set foot on the set of this movie, she was not involved in any casting or creative decisions, she did not score the film, [and] she never saw an edit or made any notes on the film\", they said.  They added that Swift did not see It Ends With Us until \"weeks after its release\" as she was \"travelling around the globe\" on tour at the time. The popstar's spokespeople argued that the subpoena \"designed to use Taylor Swift's name to draw public interest by creating tabloid clickbait instead of focusing on the facts of the case\".

    "title": "Witchcraft, innuendo and moody goth boys: Your guide to all 37 Eurovision songs",
    "content": "The 2025 Eurovision Song Contest pops its cork on Sunday, with a \"turquoise carpet\" parade featuring competitors from all 37 nations. But the competition really begins on Tuesday, when the first semi-final will see five countries unceremoniously kicked out. Another six will lose their place at the second semi-final on Thursday, before the Grand Final takes place in Basel, Switzerland, on Saturday, 17 May. This year's entrants include two returning contestants, one professional opera singer, a thinly veiled allusion to sexual emissions and a dance anthem about a dead space dog. It's a lot to take in. To help you prepare, here's a guide to all 37 songs in the contest, which I've sorted into rough musical categories, mainly for my own sanity (it didn't work). Win or lose, UK contestants Remember Monday have given headline writers a gift with the title of their entry: What The Hell Just Happened? A souped-up, full throttle pop anthem, it cherry-picks the best bits of Queen, Andrew Lloyd Webber and the Beatles, presumably to remind voters of Britain's rich musical heritage. With eight tempo changes, it could prove tricky for voters to grasp, but the band's stellar harmonies and sparkling personalities should carry them through. Crucially, the song avoids the Eurovision cliches of jackhammer dance anthems and windswept balladry – something Remember Monday have in common with this year's favourites. Sweating it out at the top are Swedish representatives KAJ, whose song Bara Bada Bastu is an ode to the restorative powers of the sauna, complete with dancers in skimpy towels. Unreasonably catchy, it's won the approval of Abba's Bjorn Ulvaeus, whose been   singing the track in his own private sauna. As you do. Stiff competition comes from Austrian singer JJ, and his operatic ballad Wasted Love. A timeworn story of unrequited love, it leans on his training as a counter-tenor, before exploding into an unexpected techno breakdown. A favourite with the bookies, the song's only Achilles heel is its similarity to last year's winner, Nemo. Distinctive in a different way is Ireland's entry, Laika Party – a 90s trance-pop anthem about a dog who was sent to space by Russia and left to die there. Singer Emmy aims for a hopeful spin on a tragic story but, despite a peppy performance, it's a bit of a downer. More palatable is Luxembourg's Laura Thorn, whose La Poupée Monte Le Son is a callback to France Gall's 1965 winning entry, Poupée De Cire, Poupée De Son. Where the original was about a \"fashion doll\" operated by songwriter Serge Gainsbourg, Thorn's response is all about taking control. \"If you think a man like you can manipulate me, go back to your mum,\" she scolds. Yeouch. Rome must be blushing. This year features not one, but two, songs about the vibrant culture of Il Bel Paese. The first comes, not surprisingly, from San Marino – the independent microstate that nestles inside north-central Italy.  Titled Tutta L'Italia, it celebrates everything from the county's football team and its vineyards, to the Mona Lisa (under her Italian name Gioconda). Written by Gabry Ponte – one of the brains behind Eiffel 65's Blue (Da Ba Dee) – it's a slight, but fun, mixture of dance beats, traditional accordion playing and the folk dances of Calabria.  The staging could be its downfall, though, with Gabry marooned behind his DJ decks while the singers, who for some reason wish to remain anonymous, obscure their faces with masks. More memorable, but definitely more unhinged, is Estonia's Espresso Macchiato. Performed by Tommy Cash (the only Eurovision contestant to have appeared on a Charli XCX record) it's an affectionate-ish caricature of Italian stereotypes, featuring the indelible lyric: \"Life is like spaghetti, it's hard until you make it\". I'm trying to give up sexual innuendo, but Eurovision is making it har... difficult. A trio of artists are trying to sneak smut past the censors, led by Malta's Miriana Conte, with a throbbing club track called Serving. In its original form, the song's chorus revolved around the phrase \"serving kant\" – the word kant being Maltese for \"singing\" and a homophone for an English term that definitely doesn't mean singing. It's a reference to a well-known phrase in the drag / ballroom world; but several countries complained it broke broadcasting guidelines, prompting a hasty re-write. If the stunt was meant to generate headlines it worked, but now that Miriana has our attention, she's not letting go.  Her performance, featuring a giant disco ball pursed between two red lips, is gloriously OTT, and she has an enviable set of pipes. Too bad the song is riddled with Europop cliche. Another contestant doubling his entendres is Australia's Go-Jo, who wants us to \"take a sip\" of milkshake from his \"special cup\". Interpret that how you want but I'd be wary of hitching a lift in his ice cream van, if I were you. With a smattering of Electric Six's saucy disco funk, Milkshake Man is tasty enough to get Australia back in the finals after only achieving a semi last year. Finally, we have Finland's Erika Vikman, whose song Ich Komme is billed as a \"joyous message of pleasure, ecstasy and a state of trance\". Structured to mimic the pneumatic realities of lovemaking, it recalls iconic gay anthems such as Kylie's Your Disco Needs You and Donna Summer's Hot Stuff – and ends with Erika shooting into the sky astride a massive gold microphone that's definitely not a stand-in for a phallus. Little in life is more devastating than the phrase \"I'm afraid it's cancer\". The disease will affect one in two of us and, although survival rates have dramatically improved, the impact can be devastating. This year, three separate Eurovision contestants have been touched by cancer, inspiring songs of unmatched heartbreak and reflection. French singer Louane captures it best. Her song Maman, is an intimate conversation with her mother, who died when she was just 17 years old. Over three verses, Louane describes the \"emptiness\" she was felt; and how she filled the void with bad behaviour and meaningless love affairs. But, as the song progresses, she tells her mum she's settled down and found purpose... by becoming a mother herself. She sings it beautifully, with a mixture of regret and strength. And when her daughter's voice appears in the final moments of the song, it would take a steely heart not to shed a tear. Over in Norway, 19-year-old Kyle Alessandro shared a similar story, when his mother was diagnosed with cancer in autumn 2023. Thankfully, she's now in remission, but something she said during her treatment inspired his Eurovision entry: \"Never lose your light.\" Kyle took that phrase and turned it into a thumping pop song about surviving adversity. \"Nothing can burn me now,\" he sings. \"I'm my own Lighter.\" Klemen Slakonja, meanwhile, is a comedian best known in Slovenia for his impressions of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin -  but his ballad, How Much Time Do We Have Left was written after his wife, actress Mojca Fatur, was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer. As he sings, Klemen's dancers raise him into the air and hold him upside down, to represent the disorientation the family felt. \"When she read her diagnosis, our world turned upside down and I felt that rush of blood in my head, the same one I feel whenever I am upside down in the performance,\" he told Eurovision World. Defying the odds, Mojca survived, and joins him on stage at Eurovision. It's a deeply intimate and moving moment. Listening to this year's line-up, it's like the contestants all heard Cascada's Evacuate the Dancefloor and went, \"Nah, we're good, thanks\". There are club bangers everywhere, with Belgium's Red Sebastian (named after the crab in The Little Mermaid, bless him) submitting an entire song about the loved-up liberation of an all-night rave. \"Where no words are needed to feel the connection / Where clocks never tick and where love is the ending.\" A favourite with fans, the 90s rave elements of Strobe Lights feel a little dated to me, but his meticulously-choreographed performance is a treat. Denmark's Sissal takes a similar sound, with a throwback Euro-bop called Hallucination that effortlessly evokes two-time Eurovision winner Loreen. Sissal said her biggest goal was for the audience to feel they couldn't sit down during the song. Mission accomplished. Germany, meanwhile, are pitching for a home run with Baller, a super-catchy trance anthem that wouldn't sound out of place at Berlin superclub Berghain. Performed by Austrian siblings Abor & Tynna, it's languishing in the middle of the field, after Tynna developed laryngitis, robbing the duo of the chance to impress fans at Eurovision's various pre-parties. But now that she's recovered, the song could rise up the rankings. That's less likely for Væb, aka the Icelandic Jedward. Their energetic dance-rap song, Róa, is all about rowing from Iceland to the Faroe Islands, \"because no matter what happens in life you just keep on rowing through the waves\".  Sadly, it's not as deep as it sounds. Spanish star Melody fares better with Esa Diva, a pumping house track with a sprinkling of flamenco guitar, that documents her journey to fame. And Azerbaijan's Mamagama go all Maroon 5 on Run With U, a smooth pop song elevated by a twinkling riff on the saz – a long-necked plucked instrument similar to the lute. OK, so I've stolen that description from Shkodra Elektronike. They're an Albanian duo living in Italy, who fuse the ethnic music of their hometown, Shkodër, to a progressive electronic sound. Their song Zjerm (Fire) imagines a time when cross-cultural understanding would lead to peace and harmony – a world without a need for soldiers and ambulances, and where \"oil would smell like lilac\" (no, me neither). Greece's entry, Asteromáta, is also rooted in history and memory, as Klavdia describes the unbreakable bond that refugees share with their homeland. \"Even if they cross the seas / They shall never forget the sacred earth they called home,\" she sings, in a haunting ballad that blends traditional Greek and Pontic elements with soaring strings. Taking a more upbeat approach is Dutch singer Claude. A refugee from the bloody civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, he moved to the Netherlands at the age of nine and fell in love with Eurovision while waiting in the refugee centre. His song, C'est La Vie, is a tribute to his mum, who taught him to see the positive in their situation. Fizzing with freedom and joy, it combines elements of chanson and French-Caribbean zouk, and looks set for a top 10 placing.  The success of \"goth gremlin witch\" Bambie Thug at last year's Eurovision has conjured a veritable coven of imitators in 2025. Polish singer Justyna Steczkowska, representing her country for the second time, even includes a Slavic magic spell in her song, Gaja – summoning the spirit of the mother Earth to \"cleanse\" her of a toxic relationship. It's a suitably intense performance, with Justyna singing long sustained notes and playing a furious violin solo, before being hoiked into the rafters on a pair ropes.   What a time to be alive. Marko Bošnjak, meanwhile, is cooking up a Poison Cake to feed to his tormentors - chiefly the people who bombarded him with homophobic hate messages after he was selected to represent Croatia. The criticism was so intense that he lost his voice and couldn't leave the house for five days. His song is suitably melodramatic, replete with guttural synths and creepy playground chants. It's a little overbaked, but should still sail through to the finals. Taking a more ethereal approach are Latvian group Tautumeitas, whose song Bur Man Laimi translates as \"a chant for happiness\". Reminiscent of Bjork and Enya, its overlapping folk harmonies are based on traditional Latvian wedding songs, making it one of this year's most captivating entries. I fear it may be too subtle to score well, though. Further mystery is provided by, Theo Evan, Cyprus's answer to Nick Jonas. The lyrics to his song, Shh, are a riddle, written by former tennis player Elke Tiel, whose \"hidden truth will only be revealed on the Eurovision stage in May\". He opens his performance perched between two pieces of scaffolding in a recreation of Leonardo da Vinci's famous Vitruvian Man sketch – so there's a clue. Shh is one of a number of gothic pop songs, sung by brooding young men with interesting hair. Among the best is Kiss Kiss Goodbye, by Czechia's Adonxs, who divebombs from an angelic falsetto to an unsettling baritone as he confronts his absent father. Lithuanian band Katarsis are an interesting experiment, with a deliberately downbeat rock song that declares \"the foundations of everything have begun to rot\". Titled Tavo Akys (your eyes), it builds to a compelling climax, but it's hard to see it being a vote-winner, unless Eurovision suddenly attracts an audience of depressed emo teens. Rounding out the field are Armenian singer Parg, with the Imagine Dragons-inspired Survivor and Serbia's Princ, whose overwrought ballad is called Mila. Both performers give it their all, but the songs don't feel strong enough to survive the semi-finals. Four years after Måneskin's victory, Eurovision's rock revival continues apace. Italy are back at it again, thanks to Lucio Corsi – think David Bowie as Pierrot – and his glam rock ballad Volevo Essere Un Duro (I wanted to be tough). A delicate anthem for people who feel they don't fit in, it recalls how Lucio was bullied as a kid, and how he's  grown to embrace his fragility. At one point, he sings: \"Instead of a star, [I'm] just a sneeze.\" It's a timeless bit of songwriting that pulls off that crucial Eurovision trick of sounding new and familiar all at once. Portuguese indie band Napa also have a 70s vibe, channelling Paul McCartney's Wings on the soft rock tear-jerker Deslocado (out of place). It's another song about migration, written after the band were forced to relocate from Madeira to the Portuguese mainland due to the economic crisis. \"Even though we've been here for a few years we always have that desire to go back, and that anguish of saying goodbye to family,\" said singer Guilherme Gomes. Last but not least are Ukraine's Ziferblat, who continue the country's astonishing run of high-quality entries in the midst of a war with Russia. Their song, Bird Of Pray, is an unexpected mix of 70s new wave band Cars, birdsong and the guitar riff from Rachel Stevens' Sweet Dreams My LA Ex – while the lyrics are full of hope for a peaceful reunion with their loved ones. It's better than that makes it sound. Where would Eurovision be without a raven-haired woman bellowing into a wind machine set to \"hurricane\"? Israel has strong form in this category, and sets the bar again with New Day Will Rise, a melancholy piano ballad sung in a mixture of English, French and Hebrew. The song's performed by Yuval Raphael, a 24-year-old who narrowly escaped with her life at the 2023 Nova music festival, where an attack by Hamas claimed the lives of 378 people and triggered Israel's ongoing offensive in Gaza. It's hard not to interpret her lyrics as a response to those events – \"everyone cries, don't cry alone\". As a result, her participation hasn't received the same level of criticism as Eden Golan, who represented Israel last year. That can't be said for Georgia's contestant, Mariam Shengelia, who has been booed during pre-Eurovision appearances for her alleged support of the country's authoritarian, pro-Russian, anti-LGBT ruling party, Georgian Dream. Shengelia has denied the accusations, pointing out that her song – a stirring, quasi-militaristic ballad called Freedom – is about \"freedom of choice, freedom to love, freedom to live as you want to live\". \"No amount of manufactured hate will change that,\" she told the Eurovision fan site Wiwibloggs. Montenegro's Nina Žižić tackles domestic abuse in Dobrodošli, a brooding and refined orchestral ballad. The singer, who previously entered Eurovision in 2013 with the cyborg pop oddity Igranka, delivers her lyrics with passion and sincerity, but somehow the song never quite takes off. Last but not least, we have defending champions Switzerland, represented by 24-year-old Zoë Më, who describes herself as a \"little fairy\". Appropriately enough, her self-penned song, Voyage is delicate as a fairy's wings,   fluttering with a soft-spoken plea to treat each other with kindness. Automatically qualifying for the final, it's a welcome oasis of calm amidst the steamy sauna sessions, moody goth haircuts and thrusting innuendo.  But that's Eurovision for you.

    "title": "Why Indiana Jones, Barbie and other US films were shot in UK",
    "content": "\"Lights, camera… tariff?\" - that's the question a scrambling movie industry has been asking this week after an unexpected intervention from US President Donald Trump. Writing on his Truth Social platform last Sunday, Trump announced plans to hit movies made in foreign countries with 100% tariffs, as he attempts to stop Hollywood dying \"a very fast death\". His threat comes as studios increasingly shift productions abroad to places such as the UK. The White House has since clarified that \"no final decision\" has been made and that they're \"exploring all options\" for revitalising the US film industry. But Trump's suggestion alone has sent shockwaves through the industry - from Hollywood to Hertfordshire - so what might all of this mean in practice? In 2014, Star Wars: The Force Awakens was shot by Disney at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, and Hollywood has kept growing closer to the UK since. Last year alone, the British Film Institute says 65% of UK production spend came from the five major US film studios and three US streaming giants - Netflix, Apple and Amazon. This amounted to £1.37bn ($1.71bn), a near 50% jump on 2023. In Hollywood, by contrast, film and television production in Los Angeles has dropped by nearly 40% over the past decade. The reason? Well largely, it's cheaper to make films in the UK. That's thanks to generous tax incentives such as the Film Tax Relief, which offers a 25% tax rebate - as well as lower labour costs and centralised national funding for film. As British actor Brian Cox told Times Radio on Tuesday: \"The reality is films go where they can afford.\" For Universal's blockbuster Jurassic World: Dominion, these incentives delivered a reported £89.1m ($111.38m) in savings. In the US, tax incentives operate on a state level - and Hollywood has relatively poor tax breaks - not only compared with the UK, which can offer 10% more, but other states such as New York and Georgia, too. Fixing that is no easy task. Trump has appointed Golden Globe Award-winning actor Jon Voight, 86, as a special ambassador to Hollywood, and met with him a day before dropping his light-on-detail proposal. But it's not exactly clear how tariffs would solve the internal tax problem in the US. A possible solution, raised by Voight, is a federal tax incentive to mirror the UK.  The Wrap's film reporter Jeremy Fuster tells the BBC it is \"unlikely\", in the current highly-charged climate, that Republicans would \"support a federal tax incentive that can easily be portrayed as a handout to 'woke Hollywood'\". And what would the impact be on moviegoers if the levy goes ahead? Fuster says costs, like any other tariffed good, would be passed onto audiences through ticket prices, premium on-demand increases or subscription rates. How exactly this would take form is \"something nobody knows\". It's not all about the money, because while a boost to US production could benefit parts of the industry, some projects will still need to shoot abroad. \"Amazon isn't going to make the next James Bond entirely in America,\" Fuster notes. Culture minister Sir Chris Bryant has said the UK government is in \"active discussions with the top of the US administration\" on the \"very fluid\" situation. With all this in mind, do you know which films have been made in the UK in recent years? BBC News has looked at some below - and they might be closer to home than you think. Warner Bros Leavesden studio in Hertfordshire, best known for producing the Harry Potter films, has been used as the set for numerous Hollywood blockbusters including Barbie, Mickey 17, Venom: The Last Dance and Beetlejuice Beetlejuice. The nearby Sky Studios Elstree in Borehamwood was turned into the magical world of Oz in 2023 as it welcomed its first production, Wicked. Beyond Hertfordshire, cities such as Glasgow have long been used as a filming hub for Hollywood movies. The opening scene of Brad Pitt's zombie thriller, World War Z, may look like Philadelphia, but the film was actually shot in George Square in the Scottish city. In November, the city was transformed into a dystopian New York as Glen Powell was spotted filming for forthcoming thriller The Running Man. It's not just dystopian films that are shot in Glasgow - in 2021, star-spangled banners, bunting and vintage shop fronts decorated the streets of Glasgow city centre for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.  The city was used for a parade scene which appears to capture 1960s New York as Apollo astronauts return home. The latest Indiana Jones movie was also shot in Northern England with Bamburgh Castle in Northumberland being used in the opening scenes.  The castle doubled up for 1944 war-torn Nazi Germany.  Other scenes were shot along the North York Moors railway line in Grosmont, and the Leaderfoot Viaduct, over the River Tweed, near Melrose, in the Scottish Borders. In 2022, The Batman used Glasgow Cathedral, the Necropolis and the Bridge of Sighs to create Gotham City, which is based on New York.  Speaking to the BBC in 2022 about the choice in filming location, director Matt Reeves said it was important to film in a location where there was \"beautiful Gothic architecture\". \"I wanted this to feel like a Gothic American city, but one that you'd never been to,\" he said. \"So we went to Glasgow and honestly it was so beautiful.\" The film's lead actor, Robert Pattinson, said: \"It looks great as Gotham, who would've thought of all the cities in the world, Glasgow as Gotham?\" Central Saint Martins art school in London was also used as a building in Gotham City, as was some parts of Liverpool.  Keen-eyed fans will spot that Gotham City Police Department is actually the Liver Building's clock tower, although the giant Liver Bird was airbrushed out. Spider-Man spin-off Morbius was filmed in Manchester's Northern Quarter and in 2010, the city became 1940s Brooklyn for Captain America: The First Avenger, starring Chris Evans. Liverpool's early 20th Century buildings has also made it a popular stand-in for New York's older skyscrapers. Liverpool was transformed into 1920s New York for Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, which sees Eddie Redmayne search the city for his escaped magical beasts. Disney's recent live-action Snow White movie was almost entirely filmed in the UK, with Pinewood Studios used for many indoor scenes and sets.  A quarry in the Lake District, a beach in Pembrokshire, Wales and a nature reserve in Burnham were all also used as shooting locations. As well as Snow White, Netflix's new thriller Havoc, starring Tom Hardy and set in an unnamed US city, was filmed in Wales.  The film's Welsh director Gareth Evans, said it was \"challenging\" to recreate a US city in south Wales, but he wanted to bring more work to the area. Swansea's Brangwyn Hall doubled up as the exterior of a fictional city police station while Cardiff's Bute Street was turned into a US boulevard with 30cm (12in) of fake snow for one of Havoc's night-time scenes. Other recent Hollywood blockbusters that have seen the majority of their filming - known as principal photography - in the UK, include: Copyright 2025 BBC.

    "title": "Kwik Fit founder Sir Tom Farmer dies aged 84",
    "content": "The founder of the Kwik Fit garage chain, Sir Tom Farmer, has died at the age of 84. The Edinburgh-born businessman died peacefully at his home in the city on Friday, his family said. He built the company into the world's biggest independent tyre and automotive chain, selling it to Ford for £1bn in 1999. Sir Tom owned a majority stake in Hibernian FC for 28 years, selling his interest in the club in 2019.  Sir Tom was born in Leith in 1940 and first opened a tyre business in 1964. He started Kwik Fit in 1971, eventually operating in more than 2,000 locations in 18 countries.  He was knighted in 1997 for his services to the automotive industry and was made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in 2009 for his charitable work.  A statement from his family said: \"Sir Tom's long and extensive career touched many aspects of Scottish and UK life.  \"His business career is well documented, as was his commitment to philanthropy, his many public roles and his unwavering support and appreciation for the communities and people that he lived his life within.\" Sir Tom's philanthropic work saw him awarded the Carnegie Medal and he became a Knight Commander with Star of the Order of St. Gregory the Great, an honour bestowed by the Pope, in 1997. \"Sir Tom's Roman Catholic faith was present throughout all areas of his life. He attended mass weekly in Edinburgh and enjoyed the friendship and company of many people with the Catholic community both here in Scotland and further afield,\" his family said. \"Sir Tom will be remembered by many for his deep commitment to his family, his work and his faith and for being at all times a proud Scotsman,\" they added. A statement from Hibernian on the social media platform X said:   \"Hibernian FC are devastated to hear of the passing of former owner Sir Tom Farmer, aged 84. \"Thank you for everything, Tom. Rest in peace.\" First Minister John Swinney wrote: \"Very sorry to hear of the death of Sir Tom Farmer, an outstanding entrepreneur and such a generous individual to so many causes in Scotland.  \"My condolences to his family.\" Scottish Secretary Ian Murray said he was a \"proud Scot\" and a \"huge contributor\" to Edinburgh's community football. Sir Tom was described as a \"family man\" in the announcement. He married Anne in 1966 after they met at their local church and they were together for 57 years until her death in 2023. Their family said Sir Tom often credited Anne for his business success: \"In later years when asked about the secret to his success, he would often say it was because he 'married a girl like Anne,'\" they said. \"They lived their whole married life in Edinburgh and are survived by their two children and four grandchildren.\" Sir Tom Farmer became better known in later life for his role at Hibs, his philanthropy and his support for younger entrepreneurs.  But his business skills had a real impact. Having made a small fortune in the 1960s, he moved to the USA, and it was there that he absorbed sales techniques he would adapt for the Kwik Fit chain he went on to found. He had an innovative, disruptive response to the oily independent repair garages his company replaced, with a new approach to branding and marketing. What really made Kwik Fit stand out was customer service and staff training. As a man of faith, Tom Farmer conveyed humility with a recognition that every individual mattered. Each employee had a role in customer service. The aim was not just to satisfy customers but to leave them \"delighted\". Relationship sales, in a service which had the customer at a disadvantage in knowing what's required to mend a car, relied on building trust in the brand. The advertising underlined that. You weren't just buying new tyres; you were buying a service from skilled staff, and the advertising portrayed them as delighted to serve. That much became standard in customer care. It was Sir Tom Farmer who brought that to Scotland, and built it out across other countries. Arguably, online commerce has sacrificed much of that human connection. Copyright 2025 BBC.

    "title": "Tips from first-time buyers: 'We bought a £320,000 home aged 26'",
    "content": "The Bank of England has cut interest rates for the second time this year - welcome news for first-time buyers after years of rising mortgage costs and spiralling house prices. But it's still tough. More than half of first-time buyers still rely on the so-called bank of mum and dad to get on the property ladder, with an average of £55,572 given in loans and gifts last year, according to estate agents Savills. We've spoken to people on a range of incomes who have managed to make it on to the ladder or are on the brink of buying. They shared with us the tactics they used to buy. Cameron Smith and Georgia Pickford, both 26, each opened a Lifetime ISA (LISA) in order to buy a three-bedroom flat in Hertfordshire together for £320,000 last year. The scheme allows 18 to 39-year-olds to save up to £4,000 a year, with a 25% government bonus, as long as it's used to buy a home under £450,000. Cameron earns £40,000 and Georgia £37,000 and they each set up a direct debit to their respective LISA accounts. \"Every month, £200 came out of my paycheque – no excuses, no distractions,\" says Cameron. Cameron increased his contributions each month, and in just under three years, the couple saved £27,740, including the government bonus from their LISAs and interest. Cameron saved £11,800 and Georgia saved £9,910. To reach the full deposit amount, they topped this up with an extra £4,260 from their personal savings. But Cameron says the scheme hasn't kept pace with rising prices. \"The £450,000 cap was set back in 2017 - it hasn't moved. If your property is even £1 over that, you lose the bonus and get hit with a 25% penalty.\" Following calls from campaigners for the terms to be updated, the Treasury Committee is reviewing whether Lifetime ISAs are still fit for purpose. Brian Byrnes, head of personal finance at Moneybox, a digital savings and investment platform, still thinks the scheme is a great option for first-time buyers. \"The Lifetime ISA works fantastically well for the vast majority of customers. Less than 1% are impacted by the £450,000 cap,\" he says. Abas Rai, 26, used a type of joint mortgage known as an \"income booster mortgage\" to buy his first home - a £207,000 two-bedroom house in Suffolk. It's a product offered by some lenders that lets a family member's income be added to yours, even if they're not living in the property, to increase how much you can borrow. Even with a £30,000 deposit and a £33,000 salary, Abas struggled to get the loan he needed. To boost his affordability, he added his father, who earns £24,000, to the mortgage. By combining their incomes, the bank was able to offer a bigger loan, though it meant his dad would also be liable if he defaults. \"The bank added our incomes together and then multiplied it by 4.5 - that's how they worked out the affordability.\" But involving a parent comes with some challenges.  \"Because the person added on to the mortgage is also added on to the property, one of the risks was my dad's age - he's 55 and coming to retirement soon, so I won't be able to rely on his salary if I default on a payment.\" Abas plans to re-mortgage and remove his dad once his income increases, but says the scheme was worth it. \"If you're not earning above, say £45,000, and you've got someone in the family, I would recommend you go for it.\" After years of renting in Oxfordshire, Alex Bonfield, 34, has relocated to Manchester to buy her first home. \"My wife is a teacher and she had to find an entirely new job up here. She really loved her old school, but this was more important,\" she says. \"It wasn't an easy decision. We don't know anyone here.\" The couple were priced out of buying near family and friends in Oxfordshire, where average house prices are £479,000, compared with £251,000 in Manchester. They began saving five years ago, and are now house-hunting in the £300,000-325,000 range with a deposit of £50,000. \"We're not at the very top of our affordability, but we are quite high up.\" They're far from alone. According to Santander UK, 67% of first-time buyers over the past two years have relocated to get on the property ladder. Oliver Jones, 27, lives in London and used a shared ownership scheme to buy his first home - a two-bedroom flat worth £500,000. He bought a 25% share with a £40,000 deposit and sub-lets to a long-time friend whom he used to rent with. \"We were tired of doing that dance every year with the landlord trying to hike up rent by stupid amounts,\" Oliver says. \"Now we're saving around £1,000 a month compared to our old flat.\" Shared ownership schemes let buyers purchase a portion of a property and pay rent on the rest. They're often more accessible but come with complexities, like service charges and limited resale flexibility. Oliver's total monthly costs come to around £1,550, including £500 for the mortgage, £800 in rent on the 75% share he doesn't own, and a £250 service charge. While he and his lodger informally split costs, Oliver covers all the housing payments. \"My mortgage rate is 5.4%, but the rent on the unowned portion is only about 2% of the property value. \"It's cheaper to just own part of the property and pay rent than to buy the whole thing with a big mortgage.\" Daniel Price, 27, bought a three-bedroom home in the South Wales Valleys earlier this year, not far from where he grew up. He started saving four and a half years ago using a Help to Buy ISA - a government scheme that topped up savings by 25%, up to a £3,000 maximum bonus. It has since been replaced by the Lifetime ISA scheme. \"Originally, my mum told me about it, so I just put a pound in to open the account,\" he says. \"I paid in £200 a month and eventually saved £11,000, which got me a £2,500 government bonus.\" House prices in the South Wales Valleys tend to be lower than in many other parts of the UK, which can make home ownership there more achievable for first-time buyers. Daniel bought his house for £95,000, below the asking price of £110,000, due to some minor renovations the property needed. \"A lot of houses were out of my price range as a single person, so I started looking further afield.\" \"My dad found the house on Rightmove and showed me it. Everything was a bit outdated, but still liveable. It just needs a bit of work to modernise it.\" When he first applied for a mortgage in October 2024, Daniel was earning £18,000 a year while doing a software development apprenticeship. By the time the sale went through in January this year, his salary had risen to £24,000. \"I started saving when I was working in a factory as a warehouse manager. I then took up a tech apprenticeship and have just finished it. That helped with my affordability.\" Camilla De Cesare, 32, is a strategy consultant. She managed to buy her first home in London alone, but says it took seven years of living with her parents and being open to buying a property that needed some work. \"My family helped me with the deposit, and I had a stable job, so I was starting from a fortunate position,\" she says. Camilla saved and invested a total of £80,000 into the S&P 500, which tracks the performance of 500 leading companies listed on the US stock market. By steadily contributing over time and benefiting from market growth, her investment pot eventually grew to £150,000. \"I was really lucky that the S&P 500, was growing really well over the years that I was investing in it, so it provided me with a really healthy cushion.\" She spent £50,000 on her deposit, and the remaining £100,000 will go towards renovations on the property over the coming years, like a new kitchen and bathroom. She says saving for a deposit felt more manageable knowing she could tackle renovations gradually, as and when she could afford them. \"I think when you first get the keys you just want to do it all at once. But there's something satisfying about looking around and knowing you did some of it yourself.\" Tom Francis, head of digital advice at financial advisers Octopus Money, says most people would benefit more from \"slow, steady saving\".  He encourages prospective buyers to break their spending into three buckets: essentials, desirables and indulgences. \"Think of your dream home as the destination - you can't get there if you don't know where you're starting.\" Sarah Tucker, CEO of the financial advice firm The Mortgage Mum, urges younger people not to wait until they've saved for a deposit before seeking financial advice from mortgage brokers. \"There's nothing better than speaking to a professional, even if you're years away from buying.\" Copyright 2025 BBC.

    "title": "'I freaked out and spent $400 online': US consumers on cheap shipping changes",
    "content": "Earlier this year, Deborah Grushkin, an enthusiastic online shopper from New Jersey, \"freaked out\". US President Donald Trump had signed an order to stop allowing packages from China worth less than $800 (£601) to enter the country free of import taxes and customs procedures. It was a move, backed by traditional retailers, that had been discussed in Washington for years amid an explosion of packages slipping into the US under the limit.  Many countries, including the UK, are considering similar measures, spurred in part by the rapid ascent of Shein and Temu. But in the US, Trump's decision to end the carve-out while ordering a blitz of new trade tariffs, including import taxes of at least 145% on goods from China, has delivered a one-two punch that has left businesses and shoppers reeling.  US-based e-commerce brands, which were set up around the system, are warning the changes could spark failures of smaller firms, while shoppers like Deborah brace for price hikes and shortages. With the 2 May deadline bearing down, the 36-year-old last month rushed in some $400 worth of items from Shein - including stickers, T-shirts, sweatshirts, Mother's Days gifts and 20 tubes of liquid eyeliner. \"I felt like maybe it was my last sort of hurrah,\" she says. Use of rules known as \"de minimis\", which allow low-value packages to avoid tariffs, customs inspections and other regulatory requirements, has surged over the last decade. Take-up accelerated during Trump's first term in office, when he raised tariffs on many Chinese goods.  By 2023, such shipments represented more than 7% of consumer imports, up from less than 0.01% a decade earlier. Last year, nearly 1.4 billion packages entered the country using the exemption - more than 3.7 million a day.  Advocates of the carve-out, which include shipping firms, say the system has streamlined trade, leading to lower prices and more options for customers. Those in favour of change, a group that includes lawmakers from both parties, say businesses are abusing rules intended to ease gifts between family and friends, and the rise has made it easier to slip products that are illegal, counterfeit or violate safety standards and other rules into the country.   Trump recently called de minimis a \"scam\", brushing off concerns about higher costs. \"Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,\" he said. However, polls suggest concerns about his economic policies are rising as the changes start to hit home. Krystal DuFrene, a retired 57-year-old from Mississippi who relies on disability payments for her income, says she has nervously been checking prices on Temu for weeks, recently cancelling an order for curtains after seeing the price more than triple.  Though she eventually found the same item for the original price in the platform's US warehouse network, she says the cost of her husband's fishing nets had more than doubled. \"I don't know who pays the tariff except the customer,\" she says. \"Everywhere is selling cheap stuff from China so I actually prefer being able to order directly.\" When the rules around de minimis changed last week, Temu said it would stop selling goods imported from China in the US directly to customers from its platform, and that all sales would now be handled by \"locally based sellers\", with orders fulfilled from within the US. Even without the latest tariffs, economists Pablo Fajgelbaum and Amit Khandelwal had estimated that ending de minimis would lead to at least $10.9bn in new costs, which they found would be disproportionately borne by lower income and minority households. \"It does kind of feel like the end of an era,\" says Gee Davis, a 40-year-old author from Missouri, who used Temu during a recent house move to buy small items such as an electric can opener and kitchen cabinet organisers. She says it was a relief to be able to easily afford the extras and the new rules felt like a \"money grab\" by the government to benefit big, entrenched American retailers like Amazon and Walmart that sell similar products - but at a bigger mark-up.  \"I don't think it's right or fair that little treats should be [restricted] to people who are richer.  \"It just would be a real bummer if everyone who was under a certain household income threshold was just no longer able to afford anything for themselves.\"  As with other Trump policy changes, questions remain about the significance of the shift.  The president was already forced to suspend the policy once before, as packages began piling up at the border.  Lori Wallach, director at Rethink Trade, which supports ending de minimis for consumer safety reasons, says the end of the exemption is significant \"on paper\", but she fears the administration is taking steps that will weaken its implementation.  She points to a recent customs notice, which said products affected by many of the new tariffs could enter the country through the informal process, a move that eases some regulatory requirements. \"Practically, because all of this stuff can come though informal entry, it's going to be extremely hard to collect tariffs or to be able to inspect really very much more than before the change happened,\" she says.  Customs and Border Protection deny the move will undermine enforcement, noting that firms are still required to supply more information than before. Businesses have indicated they are taking the changes seriously. Both Shein and Temu last month warned customers that prices would rise, while Temu says it is rapidly expanding its network of US-based sellers and warehouses to protect its low prices.  Other business groups say many smaller, less high-profile American brands that manufacture abroad for US customers are struggling - and may not survive.  \"If the tariffs weren't in place, it would be like taking a little bit of bitter medicine,\" says Alex Beller, board member of the Ecommerce Innovation Alliance, a business lobby group and a co-founder of Postscript, which works with thousands of smaller businesses on text messaging marketing.  \"But paired with the other tariffs, especially for brands that manufacture in China, it just becomes an insurmountable shift.\" In a letter to the government last month, men's clothing company Indochino, known for its custom suits made-to-order in China, warned that ending de minimis posed a \"significant threat to the viability\" of its business and other mid-size American firms like it. Steven Borelli is the chief executive of the athleisure clothing firm CUTS, which manufactures outside the US, shipping products to a warehouse in Mexico, from where packages are mailed to customers in the US.  His firm has been pushing to reduce its reliance on China, halting orders in the country months ago. Still, he says he is now considering price increases and job cuts.  He says his business has room to manoeuvre, since it caters to higher income customers, but he expects \"thousands\" of other brands to die without changes to the situation.  \"We want more time,\" he says. \"The speed at which everything is happening is too fast for businesses to adjust.\"  Copyright 2025 BBC.

    "title": "The US and China are finally talking. Why now?",
    "content": "The US-China trade war could be letting up, with the world's two largest economies beginning talks in Switzerland.  Top trade officials from both sides met on Saturday in the first high-level meeting since US President Donald Trump hit China with tariffs in January.  Beijing retaliated immediately and a tense stand-off ensued as the two countries heaped levies on each other. New US tariffs on Chinese imports stand at 145%, and some US exports to China face duties of 125%. There have been weeks of stern, and sometimes fiery, rhetoric where each side sought to paint the other as the more desperate party.  And yet this weekend they face each other over the negotiating table.   So why now? Despite multiple rounds of tit-for-tat tariffs, both sides have been sending signals that they want to break the deadlock. Except it wasn't clear who would blink first.  \"Neither side wants to appear to be backing down,\" said Stephen Olson, senior visiting fellow at Singapore's ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute and a former US trade negotiator.  \"The talks are taking place now because both countries have judged that they can move forward without appearing to have caved in to the other side.\" Still, China's foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian emphasised on Wednesday that \"the talks are being held at the request of the US\".   And the commerce ministry framed it as a favour to Washington, saying it was answering the \"calls of US businesses and consumers\". The Trump administration, however, claims it's Chinese officials who \"want to do business very much\" because \"their economy is collapsing\". \"They said we initiated? Well, I think they ought to go back and study their files,\" Trump said at the White House on Wednesday. But as the talks drew closer, the president struck a more diplomatic note: \"We can all play games. Who made the first call, who didn't make the - it doesn't matter,\" he told reporters on Thursday. \"It only matters what happens in that room.\" The timing is also key for Beijing because it's during Xi's visit to Moscow. He was a guest of honour on Friday at Moscow's Victory Day parade to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the World War Two victory over Nazi Germany.   Xi stood alongside leaders from across the Global South - a reminder to Trump's administration that China not only has other options for trade, but it is also presenting itself as an alternative global leader. This allows Beijing to project strength even as it heads to the negotiating table. Trump insists that the tariffs will make America stronger, and Beijing has vowed to \"fight till the end\"- but the fact is the levies are hurting both countries.  Factory output in China has taken a hit, according to government data. Manufacturing activity in April dipped to the lowest level since December 2023. And a survey by news outlet Caixin this week showed that services activity has reached a seven-month low. The BBC found that Chinese exporters have been reeling from the steep tariffs, with stock piling up in warehouses, even as they strike a defiant note and look for markets beyond the US.  \"I think [China] realises that a deal is better than no deal,\" says Bert Hofman, a professor at the East Asian Institute in National University Singapore.  \"So they've taken a pragmatic view and said, 'OK, well we need to get these talks going.'\" And so with the major May Day holiday in China over, officials in Beijing have decided the time is right to talk. On the other side, the uncertainty caused by tariffs led to the US economy contracting for the first time in three years.  And industries that have long depended on Chinese-made goods are especially worried. A Los Angeles toy company owner told the BBC that they were \"looking at the total implosion of the supply chain\". Trump himself has acknowledged that US consumers will feel the sting. American children may \"have two dolls instead of 30 dolls\", he said at a cabinet meeting this month, \"and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally\".  Trump's approval ratings have also slid over fears of inflation and a possible recession, with more than 60% of Americans saying he was focusing too much on tariffs. \"Both countries are feeling pressure to provide a bit of reassurance to increasingly nervous markets, businesses, and domestic constituencies,\" Mr Olson says.  \"A couple of days of meetings in Geneva will serve that purpose.\" While the talks have been met with optimism, a deal may take a while to materialise. The talks will mostly be about \"touching base\", Mr Hofman said, adding that this could look like an \"exchange of positions\" and, if things go well, \"an agenda [will be] set for future talks\". The negotiations on the whole are expected to take months, much like what happened during Trump's first term. After nearly two years of tit-for-tat tariffs, the US and China signed a \"phase one\" deal in early 2020 to suspend or reduce some levies. Even then, it did not include thornier issues, such as Chinese government subsidies for key industries or a timeline for scrapping the remaining tariffs.  In fact, many of them stayed in place through Joe Biden's presidency, and Trump's latest tariffs add to those older levies.   What could emerge this time is a \"phase one deal on steroids\", Mr Olson said: that is, it would go beyond the earlier deal and try to address flashpoints. There are many, from the illegal fentanyl trade which Washington wants China to crack down harder on to Beijing's relationship with Moscow.  But all of that is far down the line, experts warn.  \"The systemic frictions that bedevil the US-China trade relationship will not be solved any time soon,\" Mr Olson adds. \"Geneva will only produce anodyne statements about 'frank dialogues' and the desire to keep talking.\" Copyright 2025 BBC.

    "title": "UK prepared to pay to access EU defence programmes",
    "content": "The UK government is willing to pay for UK companies to gain access to EU defence spending programmes worth hundreds of billions of pounds. Defence Secretary John Healey told the BBC: \"We are prepared to pay our fair share but we want to have a say in the programmes, while retaining UK intellectual property and export opportunities.\" He also promised that three-quarters of any money spent supporting Ukraine would be spent with UK companies. EU Commission officials have indicated that the UK might be shut out of defence procurement programs unless they \"pay to play\".  As the sights and sounds of the 80th anniversary of VE Day fade, thoughts across the world are turning to the potential conflicts of the future. Russian aggression to the east, and a United States less keen on providing the west with a security blanket, have focused minds - and budgets - on Europe's military needs. In March of this year, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, announced plans to raise up to €800bn (£680bn) to bolster European defences and support Ukraine. UK companies want to be on the frontline of this spending and defence giant BAE Systems has been adding extra staff shifts and transformational changes to their supply chains. The BBC gained rare access to BAE Systems' artillery factory in Washington Tyne and Wear, where it makes thousands of the 155 millimetre shells that have been in such high demand and short supply in Ukraine's resistance to Russia's invasion. The plant now operates 24 hours a day and new supply chains, that source more of the explosives and propellants domestically, mean that the plant, along with its sister facility in South Wales, can increase production 16-fold over the next five years,  according to BAE munitions chief Steve Cardew. \"I think it's really clear there is going to be a long period of restocking and replenishment needed,\" he says. They are planning to increase production capacity for ammunition through a programme of work, building new machines in Washington and a new filling facility in south Wales. \"Fundamentally, it's about more manufacturing capacity, and it's also about building resilience in our supply chain, so explosives and propellants are sourced here in the UK, where we have more control over it, more sovereignty over that critical item in our ammunition production,\" he says. Across the whole company, BAE has added 15,000 staff over the past five years and invested an additional £1bn in the UK. John Healey says the lessons learned in Ukraine will benefit the UK economy. \"We need to respond to an insecure world, but by doing so we will boost British business.  \"I spend as much time talking to investors as I do to industry these days,\" he says. \"What we lost sight of in this country is that if a country is under threat, its forces are only as strong as the industry that stands behind them. \"Defence already supports 400,000 jobs and 12,000 companies and we will measure the increase in defence spending by an increase in British jobs.\" The government has already laid out plans to increase defence spending from 2.3% to 2.5% of GDP from 2027. That additional £6bn will be transferred from the international aid budget. But some defence experts say it is more likely that money will be largely spent on basic infrastructure than new weapons. \"The first challenge they have is there are more priorities than there is actually money to spend,\" says Matthew Saville, the director of military sciences at the Royal United Service Institute. \"I think the first thing that they'll be looking at is actually to fill out some of the gaps that there are in defence and improve the foundations,\" he says. This means more spending on training and recruitment, as well as large infrastructure and accommodation, before tanks, planes and aircraft have even been considered. The other lesson from the Ukraine war is the changing nature of the battlefield.  Drones have become very effective and Ukraine is now the biggest manufacturer of drones in Europe. But BAE executives are quick to point out that through a series of acquisitions, it is now the second. As Europe's biggest defence contractor, BAE is well-placed to benefit as Europe rearms. BAE's share price has tripled since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Wars are costly - in human and financial terms. UK government debt ballooned to 250% of GDP by the end of the Second World War. But if there's defence spending to be done, the UK government believes the benefits of being involved are worth paying for. Copyright 2025 BBC.

    "title": "Trump proposes 80% China tariff ahead of trade talks ",
    "content": "US President Donald Trump has proposed cutting tariffs on goods from China, in his latest comment to signal interest in de-escalating the trade war between the world's two biggest economies.  \"80% Tariff on China seems right,\" Trump wrote on social media on Friday, ahead of trade talks between the two countries in Switzerland.  China's Vice Foreign Minister Hua Chunying also struck a confident note ahead of the meetings, saying Beijing had \"full confidence\" in its ability to manage trade issues with the US. Since returning to the White House, Trump has hit Chinese imports with 145% tariffs and China has retaliated with levies of 125% on some US goods, driving down trade between the two nations. On Friday, official figures for April showed China's exports to the US fell by more than 20% compared to a year earlier. But at the same time its total exports rose by a better-than-expected 8.1%. Officials in both Washington and Beijing are \"under growing economic pressure\", Dan Wang from political risk consultancy Eurasia Group told the BBC. \"The recent signals from both sides suggest a transactional de-escalation is on the table\", she added. The announcement earlier this week of the talks was welcomed as an important first step towards easing tensions but analysts have warned that this marks the start of what are likely to be lengthy negotiations. \"The systemic frictions between the US and China will not be resolved any time soon,\" said former US trade negotiator, Stephen Olson. Any cuts to tariffs as a result of this meeting are likely to be \"minor\", he added. The initial negotiations will be led by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China's Vice Premier and economic tsar He Lifeng. But \"I think everyone recognises that any final deal will require the active engagement of both presidents,\" Mr Olson said.  Another trade expert said that even if the new tariffs imposed by Trump were lifted, the two countries would still have major issues to overcome. \"A realistic goal is probably at best a pullback from the sky-high bilateral tariffs but that would still leave in place high tariff barriers and various other restrictions\", the former head of the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) China division, Eswar Prasad told BBC News. On social media on Friday, Trump called on China to \"open up its market\" to the US. He said any tariff reduction would be \"up to Scott B\".  In earlier remarks on Thursday, he had said he expected a \"very friendly\" meeting.  The talks between China and the US are set to take place just two days after the UK became the first country to strike a tariffs deal with the Trump administration.  The US agreed to reduce import taxes on a set number of British cars and allow some steel and aluminium into the country tariff-free, in exchange for new access to US beef and other exports, according to an outline of the new agreement. Countries around the world are scrambling to make similar deals before steep US import taxes are due to take effect next month. Trump announced what he called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on dozens of countries in April but paused them shortly afterwards for 90 days to give their governments time to negotiate with his administration. Businesses based in the US will also be watching events in Switzerland closely. Wild Rye, a women's outdoor clothing firm based in the state of Idaho, has manufacturing stations in China and has been severely affected by the tariffs.  The cost of shipping goods has jumped significantly, the firm's chief executive, Cassie Abel, told the BBC's Today programme. \"We have a purchase order that's incoming, which is around $700,000 [of goods] that's now costing £1.2m in levies up from £200,000,\" she said.  Ms Abel added she was now looking to sell parts of her business to try to raise cash.

    "title": "Elton John and Dua Lipa seek protection from AI",
    "content": "Dua Lipa, Sir Elton John,  Sir Ian McKellen and Florence Welch are among a list of stars calling on the prime minister to update copyright laws in a way that protects them from artificial intelligence. A letter signed by more than 400 British musicians, writers and artists, addressed to Sir Keir Starmer, says failing to give that protection would mean them \"giving away\" their work to tech firms. Also at risk, they write, is \"the UK's position as a creative powerhouse\". They want the PM to back an amendment to the Data (Use and Access) Bill that would require developers to be transparent with copyright owners about using their material to train AI models. A government spokesperson said: \"We want our creative industries and AI companies to flourish, which is why we're consulting on a package of measures that we hope will work for both sectors. \"We're clear that no changes will be considered unless we are completely satisfied they work for creators,\" they added. Other signatories include author Kazuo Ishiguro, playwright David Hare, singers Kate Bush and Robbie Williams, as well as Coldplay, Tom Stoppard and Richard Curtis. Sir Paul McCartney, who told the BBC in January he was concerned about AI ripping off artists, has also signed the letter. \"We are wealth creators, we reflect and promote the national stories, we are the innovators of the future, and AI needs us as much as it needs energy and computer skills,\" it states. They say their concerns can be met if the government backs an amendment proposed by Baroness Beeban Kidron ahead of a key vote in the House of Lords on Monday. Baroness Kidron's amendment, it says, would \"allow both AI developers and creators to develop licensing regimes that will allow for human-created content well into the future.\" Not everyone agrees with the artists' approach. Julia Willemyns, co-founder of the Centre for British Progress think tank, said such proposals could hamper the UK and its bid for growth.  The measures would \"do nothing to stop foreign firms from using content from the British creative industries,\" she told the BBC. \"A restrictive copyright regime would offshore AI development, chill domestic innovation, and directly harm the UK economy,\" she said. However, the letter comes amid mounting concern from artists over the inclusion of their works, and material protected by copyright, in the data used to develop generative AI systems.  These tools, which can produce new content in response to simple text prompts, have become increasingly popular and available to consumers. But their capabilities have been accompanied by concerns and criticism over their data use and energy demand. In February, artists including Annie Lennox and Damon Albarn released a silent album to protest about the government's proposed changes to copyright law. The government carried out a consultation around its proposal to allow developers to be able to use creators' content on the internet to help develop their models, unless the rights holders elect to \"opt out\". According to The Guardian, ministers were reconsidering the proposal following creator backlash. Mr Ishiguro pointed the BBC to an earlier statement in which he wrote, \"why is it just and fair - why is it sensible - to alter our time-honoured copyright laws to advantage mammoth corporations at the expense of individual writers, musicians, film-makers and artists?\" The Nobel Prize-winning author added that since then the only limited advance was that it now appeared the government had accepted the opt-out proposals were not likely to be workable, He thought a new consultation to find a fairer scheme was possible, though it remained to be seen how meaningful any consultation would be. \"It's essential that they get this right,\" he wrote. MPs recently rejected a separate amendment tabled by Baroness Kidron that aimed to make AI developers accountable to UK copyright law. Now, she says transparency obligations for tech firms under the new proposed amendment could support the development of licensing agreements between creators and companies. \"The UK is in a unique position to take its place as a global player in the international AI supply chain, but to grasp that opportunity requires the transparency provided for in my amendments, which are essential to create a vibrant licencing market,\" Baroness Kidron said. In their statement the government said: \"It's vital we take the time to work through the range of responses to our consultation, but equally important that we put in the groundwork now as we consider the next steps.  \"That is why we have committed to publishing a report and economic impact assessment – exploring the broad range of issues and options on all sides of the debate.\" Copyright 2025 BBC.

    "title": "Two porn sites investigated for suspected age check failings",
    "content": "Ofcom has launched investigations into two pornographic websites it believes may be falling foul of the UK's newly introduced child safety rules. The regulator said Itai Tech Ltd - which operates a so-called \"nudifying\" site - and Score Internet Group LLC had failed to detail how they were preventing children from accessing their platforms. Ofcom announced in January that, in order to comply with the Online Safety Act, all websites on which pornographic material could be found must introduce \"robust\" age-checking techniques from July. It said the two services it was investigating did not appear to have any effective age checking mechanisms. Firms found to be in breach of the Act face huge fines. The regulator said on Friday that many services publishing their own porn content had, as required, provided details of \"highly effective age assurance methods\" they were planning to implement. They added that this \"reassuringly\" included some of the largest services that fall under the rules. It said a small number of services had also blocked UK users entirely to prevent children accessing them. Itai Tech Ltd and Score Internet Group LLC did not respond to its request for information or show they had plans to introduce age checks, it added. The \"nudifying\" technology that one of the company's platforms features involves the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to create the impression of having removed a person's clothing in an image or video. The Children's Commissioner recently called on the government to introduce a total ban on such AI apps that could be used to create sexually explicit images of children. Under the Online Safety Act, platforms that publish their own pornographic content were required to take steps to implement age checks from January. These can include requiring UK users to provide photo ID or running credit card checks. But all websites where a user might encounter pornographic material are also required to demonstrate the robustness of the measures they are taking to verify the age of users. These could even apply to some social media platforms, Ofcom told the BBC in January. The rules are expected to change the way many UK adults will use or encounter some digital services, such as porn sites. \"As age checks start to roll out in the coming months, adults will start to notice a difference in how they access certain online services,\" said Dame Melanie Dawes, Ofcom's chief executive, in January. In April, Discord said it would start testing face-scanning as a way to verify some users' ages in the UK and Australia.  Experts said it marked \"the start of a bigger shift\" for platforms as lawmakers worldwide look to impose strict internet safety rules. Critics suggest such measures risk pushing young people to \"darker corners\" of the internet where there are smaller, less regulated sites hosting more violent or explicit material.

    "title": "Pay day banking outages hit 1.2m people, banks reveal",
    "content": "About 1.2m people in the UK were affected by banking outages that happened on what was pay day for many earlier this year. The details have emerged in letters from Lloyds, TSB, Nationwide and HSBC to Dame Meg Hillier, the chair of the Commons Treasury Committee, which is looking into the incident that occurred on Friday, 28 February. HSBC also revealed that customers had to wait two hours on average that day to reach its online customer service team. Its standard target wait time is five minutes. In their correspondence, the banks said they had paid compensation to affected customers and also outlined what they were doing to try to prevent similar problems in the future. Lloyds Banking Group customers faced the biggest impact from the February outages.  Ron van Kemenade, the bank's group chief operating officer, said around 700,000 people who are customers of Lloyds, Halifax, Bank of Scotland and MBNA were affected as they couldn't log into their accounts on a first attempt. However Mr van Kemenade argued it did not amount to an outage, as there were five million successful logins during the period of disruption.  Nonetheless, the bank said it was improving its log-in infrastructure and monitoring systems following the incident. The letters from the banks revealed about 250,000 TSB customers, 196,255 from Nationwide and 60,000 from HSBC also faced disruption on that morning. The banks have paid out over £114,000 in compensation to customers so far, with Nationwide (£84,341) paying the most. All the banks said there was no evidence of an increase in fraudulent activity during the disruption, and said there was also no indication that outages were more prevalent at some times - such as pay days - than at other periods. The pay day outage was far from the only IT problem the banking sector has experienced. In March, it emerged that nine major banks and building societies operating in the UK accumulated at least 803 hours - the equivalent of 33 days - of tech outages in the past two years. The Treasury Committee - which has been investigating the impact of banking IT failures - compelled Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, Nationwide, Santander, NatWest, Danske Bank, Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank to provide the data. The report also said Barclays could now face compensation payments of £12.5m following an outage there that affected customers on pay day in January. Experts including Patrick Burgess of BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, and Shilpa Doreswamy, a director with GFT, a company committed to the digital transformation of the financial sector, have stated that the recent outages reveal the problems banks have with ageing infrastructure and failing IT systems. Ms Doreswamy told the BBC on Thursday that payday outages were \"not just a case of unfortunate timing\" but also predictable, preventable events.  \"They've highlighted the need for banks to invest in IT modernisation to prevent the eroding of customer trust,\" she said. Not acting to reduce the possibility of downtime or frustration for customers - particularly during high-demand periods - could potentially see banks risk their reputation and losing customers, Ms Doreswamy added. \"When customers can't access their wages, pay bills or run their businesses, the impact is not just financial, it becomes deeply personal.\" Additional reporting by Liv McMahon Sign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

    "title": "Wikipedia legally challenges 'flawed' online safety rules",
    "content": "Wikipedia is taking legal action against new Online Safety Act regulations it says could threaten the safety of its volunteer editors and their ability to keep harmful content off the site. The Wikimedia Foundation - the non-profit which supports the online encyclopaedia - is seeking a judicial review of rules which could mean Wikipedia is subjected to the toughest duties required of websites under the act. Lead counsel Phil Bradley-Schmieg said it was \"unfortunate that we must now defend the privacy and safety of Wikipedia's volunteer editors from flawed legislation\". The government told the BBC it was committed to implementing the act but could not comment on ongoing legal proceedings. It's thought this is the first judicial review to be brought against the new online safety laws - albeit a narrow part of them - but experts say it may not be the last. \"The Online Safety Act is vast in scope and incredibly complex,\" Ben Packer, a partner at law firm Linklaters, told the BBC. The law would inevitably have impacts on UK citizens' freedom of expression and other human rights, so as more of it comes into force \"we can expect that more challenges may be forthcoming\", he told the BBC. These will add to the array of challenges the act already faces, from claims its burdensome rules are forcing harmless small websites to close - to those who argue the law and its enforcement are too weak and not up to the job. The OSA requires the regulator, Ofcom, to categorise platforms according to a number of factors, including how many users they have and what features they offer. Those designated \"Category 1\" - the highest level - will face additional duties to keep users safe. In very simple terms, sites are most likely to be classed as Category 1 if they allow millions of UK users to interact and share content with each other, and have systems that recommend content. These rules were originally designed to target the services where UK users were most likely to encounter harmful content - but Wikipedia is concerned they are so vaguely defined there is \"a significant risk\" it will be included in Category 1. If that happened, the consequences for the army of volunteers who write and edit articles could be serious and would reach beyond the UK, the Foundation argues. It has singled out additional duties which could, in effect, require the site to verify the identities of its volunteers - something it fears could expose them to data breaches, stalking, vexatious lawsuits or even imprisonment by authoritarian regimes.  \"We would be forced to collect data about our contributors, and that would compromise their privacy and safety, and what that means is that people would feel less safe as contributors\", Rebecca MacKinnon the Wikimedia Foundation's vice president of global advocacy told the BBC  \"We've seen in other parts of the world, when people do not feel safe contributing to Wikipedia, then they shy away from controversial topics that may be challenging to to people who are powerful, and that reduces the quality and the usefulness of the encyclopaedia\". The Wikimedia Foundation stresses it is not trying to challenge the OSA in general, or the idea that there should be Category 1 services subject to additional duties. Instead, it is challenging parts of the so-called \"Categorisation Regulations\" that set out how the regulator Ofcom will decide which sites will have to follow the most stringent duties.  It argues, as currently defined, they risk not only inappropriately catching sites such as Wikipedia but also missing some platforms which should be abiding by tougher rules. \"The Regulations do not just risk overregulating low risk \"outlier\" services, like Wikipedia,\" Phil Bradley-Schmieg wrote in a blog post. \"As designed, the regulations will also fail to catch many of the services UK society is actually concerned about, like misogynistic hate websites\". The foundation argues its volunteers already do an effective job of keeping harmful content off the platform. After the 2024 Southport murders, volunteers worked night and day to provide reliable and neutral information Mr Bradley-Schmieg wrote. Ben Packer argues the foundation will have a high bar to cross to convince a court that the Secretary of State acted unlawfully making the regulations. \"Typically, it is difficult to succeed in a judicial review challenging regulations,\" he told BBC News. \"Here, Wikimedia will be challenging regulations set by the Secretary of State on the advice of Ofcom, after they had conducted research and consultation on where those thresholds should be set,\" he pointed out. Ofcom has not yet categorised any services, but has requested information from a number of sites - including Wikipedia - and is awaiting responses. In a statement it said: We note the Wikimedia Foundation's decision to challenge the categorisation regulations set by the Secretary of State under the Online Safety Act.\" Copyright 2025 BBC.

    "title": "Apple hits back at US judge's 'extraordinary' contempt order",
    "content": "Apple is asking an appeals court to pause a US district judge's recent ruling in a case which could determine the future of its highly lucrative App Store. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found last week the tech giant wilfully violated an order she had previously made in a case filed by Fortnite-maker Epic Games. That order - handed down in 2021 - demanded Apple refrain from anti-competitive conduct and pricing and allow outside payment options in the App Store. Last week she determined Apple was flouting that demand - a finding Apple has now called \"extraordinary.\" The iPhone maker has alleged in a court filing that her order unlawfully prevents the company from controlling \"core aspects of its business operations.\" \"A federal court cannot force Apple to permanently give away free access to its products and services, including intellectual property,\" the company's lawyers wrote. Both of Judge Gonzalez Rogers' judgements stem from an antitrust case filed by Epic Games. In 2020, Epic accused the iPhone-maker of possessing an illegal monopoly with its App Store, which collected commissions of between 15% and 30% on in-app purchases. The judge rejected Epic's monopoly claims, but found Apple was stopping developers from giving users alternative payment options in violation of California competition rules. She ordered Apple to make changes that would help developers steer customers to cheaper payment options outside of the Apple ecosystem. Last year, Epic accused Apple of failing to comply by creating a new set of fees for developers instead. In a contempt order last week, Judge Gonzalez Rogers found that Apple continued to interfere with competition, saying that internal company documents showed Apple deliberately violated her 2021 injunction.  On Wednesday, Apple requested an appeals court take action, including by lifting a ban that stops it from charging developers fees on purchases made outside the App Store.  The company wrote that such restrictions \"will cost Apple substantial sums annually\" and are based on conduct that has not been found unlawful. \"Rather, they were imposed to punish Apple for purported non-compliance with an earlier state-law Injunction that is itself invalid,\" Apple wrote. In response, Epic Games said Judge Gonzalez Rogers' contempt order last week was already benefitting consumers. \"Apple has faced a surge of genuine competition as developers have updated their apps with better payment methods, better deals, and better consumer choice,\" Epic wrote in a post on the social media platform X. The company criticized Apple's motion as \"a last ditch effort to block competition and extract massive junk fees at the expense of consumers and developers.\" Epic says it is on track with plans to bring Fortnite back to iPhones and iPads. Apple removed Fortnite from its App Store in 2020 after Epic unveiled an in-app payment system into the game. The move led to the current court battle between the two companies. Apple did not directly addresses Judge Gonzalez Rogers' stunning rebuke of company executives in its court filing.  In her most recent order, she said CEO Tim Cook ignored executive Phillip Schiller's urging to have Apple comply with her injunction, and allowed then-Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri to convince him not to. \"Cook chose poorly,\" she wrote. The company documents she reviewed reveal \"that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option\", she wrote. Judge Gonzalez Rogers said she would refer the matter to the US Attorney for Northern District of California to investigate if a criminal contempt proceeding against Apple is appropriate. Apple said last week it would comply with the court's order while it appeals. Sign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends. Outside the UK? Sign up here.

    "title": "Arizona man shot to death in road rage 'returns' to address his killer",
    "content": "Chris Pelkey died in a road rage shooting in Arizona three years ago.  But with the help of artificial intelligence, he returned earlier this month at his killer's sentencing to deliver a victim's statement himself.  Family members said they used the burgeoning technology to let Mr Pelkey use his own words to talk about the incident that took his life.   While some experts argue the unique use of AI is just another step into the future, others say it could become a slippery slope for using the technology in legal cases.  His family used voice recordings, videos and pictures of Mr Pelkey, who was 37 when he was killed, to recreate him in a video using AI, his sister Stacey Wales told the BBC.  Ms Wales said she wrote the words that the AI version read in court based on how forgiving she knew her brother to be.  \"To Gabriel Horcasitas, the man who shot me, it is a shame we encountered each other that day in those circumstances,\" said the AI version of Mr Pelkey in court. \"In another life, we probably could have been friends.\" \"I believe in forgiveness, and a God who forgives. I always have and I still do,\" the AI verison of Mr Pelkey - wearing a grey baseball cap - continues.  The technology was used at his killer's sentencing - Horcasitas already had been found guilty by a jury - some four years after Horcasitas shot Mr Pelkey at a red light in Arizona. The Arizona judge who oversaw the case, Todd Lang, seemed to appreciate the use of AI at the hearing. He sentenced Horcasitas to 10-and-a-half years in prison on manslaughter charges. \"I loved that AI, thank you for that. As angry as you are, as justifiably angry as the family is, I heard the forgiveness,\" Judge Lang said. \"I feel that that was genuine.\" Paul Grimm, a retired federal judge and Duke Law School professor, told the BBC he was not surprised to see AI used in the Horcasitas sentencing.  Arizona courts, he notes, already have started using AI in other ways. When the state's Supreme Court issues a ruling, for example, it has an AI system that makes those rulings digestible for people.  And Mr Grimm said because it was used without a jury present, just for a judge to decide sentencing, the technology was allowed.  \"We'll be leaning [AI] on a case-by-case basis, but the technology is irresistible,\" he said. But some experts like Derek Leben, a business ethics professor at Carnegie Mellon University, are concerned about the use of AI and the precedent this case sets.  While Mr Leben does not question this family's intention or actions, he worries not all uses of AI will be consistent with a victim's wishes.   \"If we have other people doing this moving forward, are we always going to get fidelity to what the person, the victim in this case, would've wanted?\" Mr Leben asked.  For Ms Wales, however, this gave her brother the final word. \"We approached this with ethics and morals because this is a powerful tool. Just like a hammer can be used to break a window or rip down a wall, it can also be used as a tool to build a house and that's how we used this technology,\" she said.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

    "title": "Moon dust 'rarer than gold' arrives in UK from China",
    "content": "The first samples of Moon rock brought back to Earth in nearly 50 years have arrived in the UK - on loan from China. The tiny grains of dust are now locked inside a safe in a high security facility in Milton Keynes - we were given the first look at them. Professor Mahesh Anand is the only scientist in the UK to have been loaned this extremely rare material, which he describes as \"more precious than gold dust\". \"Nobody in the world had access to China's samples, so this is a great honour and a huge privilege,\" he says. After grinding and zapping the dust with lasers, Prof Anand's team hope to answer fundamental questions about how the Moon formed and about the early years of planet Earth. Inside the grains of dust could be evidence to back up scientists' theory that the Moon was made from the debris thrown out when Earth struck a Mars-sized planet 4.5 billion years ago.  China collected the rocks on its Chang'e 5 space mission in 2020 when it landed on a volcanic area called Mons Rümker.  A robotic arm drilled into the soil to collect 2kg of material, which was brought back to Earth in a capsule which landed in Inner Mongolia.  It was the first successful lunar sampling since a Soviet mission in 1976 and catapulted China into a leading position in the new space race. Now, following a long tradition of global collaboration between space scientists, China has for the first time granted seven international researchers access to the samples to allow them to make new discoveries. The tiny vials were handed to Prof Anand at a glamorous ceremony in Beijing last week, where he met colleagues from Russia, Japan, Pakistan and Europe. \"It was almost like a parallel universe - and China is so far ahead of us in terms of their investment in space programmes,\" he said. He returned to the UK with the precious cargo in the safest place he could think of - his hand luggage. At his lab at the Open University in Milton Keynes, we step onto sticky mats to clean our shoes and put on plastic gloves, gowns, hair nets and hoods. The environment inside this high security room must be spotless to prevent contamination. If Earthly material mixes with these extra-terrestrial specks, it could permanently ruin the analysis Prof Anand's team will do.  We crouch down on the floor in front of a row of safes. Prof Anand unlocks one and carefully pulls out a ziplock bag with three containers the size of boxes that could keep a necklace. Wedged firmly in each one is a see-through vial with a dusting of dark grey at the bottom.  That is the Moon dust.  It looks underwhelming, but it is humbling to think of its cosmic journey. And Prof Anand says they don't need any more than this 60mg in total. \"Here, the small is mighty. Believe me, it is enough to keep us busy for years to come because we specialise in working on the micro,\" he adds.  In a lab down the corridor, technician Kay Knight will be the first person to actually work on the grains when the vials are opened. She's been cutting and grinding pieces of rocks for 36 years, but this will be the first time she's worked on something straight from the lunar surface. \"I'm extremely excited,\" she says, after showing us how she cuts meteorites using a diamond blade. \"But I'm nervous - there's not much of the samples and they can't really go and get more very easily. This is high stakes,\" she adds. After she prepares the samples, they will go into two more labs. In one, we see a machine with an intricate network of countless tubes, valves and wires. Technician Sasha Verchovsky has been building it since the early 1990s. He shows us the small cylinder where the specs of dust can be heated to 1400C. That will help them extract carbon, nitrogen and noble gases. This is completely unique, and is one of the reasons Prof Anand believes his lab was chosen to receive the rare samples. James Malley, a research technician, operates a machine that can work out how much oxygen is contained within the specs of dust. He shows us a test run of what he will do. \"I'm going to hit that grain on the tray with a laser,\" he says, showing the scene magnified on a computer screen. \"It's going to start to glow, and you will see it melt inwards,\" he says. The team has a year to finish their research. By the end, their search for answers will probably end up destroying the samples. But China has gone further since the Chang'e 5 mission.  In 2024 its Chang'e 6 launch brought back the first samples from the far side of the Moon. It's a deeply mysterious place that might have evidence of long-quiet volcanic lava flows. \"I very much hope that this is the beginning of a long-term collaboration between China and international scientists,\" says Prof Anand. \"A lot of us built our careers working on samples returned by Apollo missions, and I think this is a fantastic tradition to follow. I hope that other countries will follow suit,\" he adds. Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day. Sign up here. Copyright 2025 BBC.

    "title": "Litter 'nightmare' as street cleanliness worst on record",
    "content": "Littering has reached a \"crisis point,\" campaigners have said, after surveys of street cleanliness across Wales revealed the worst situation on record. Keep Wales Tidy said the rise was mainly being driven by a \"huge increase\" of on-the-go food and drinks packaging, as well as pressure on council street cleaning budgets. Councils told BBC news they were \"struggling\" to maintain budgets to clear litter in the face of increased costs in other areas, like social care. The Welsh government said it was working with local authorities and others to ensure \"more clean and cared for areas\". Keep Wales Tidy's annual report found the worst results for street cleanliness in the 17 years since the charity's surveys began. Keep Britain Tidy said it was an issue right across the country and \"only a small fraction of locations\" in England were completely litter free. Despite declaring \"a litter emergency\" in 2022, Keep Scotland Beautiful also warned that litter levels continued to rise. In Wales, the problem was found to be worst in towns and cities - with more than 35% of urban areas seeing \"unacceptable\" levels of litter. There was also a 286% increase in the number of the most dirty streets, graded \"D\" for cleanliness. Smoking-related litter and food and drinks packaging were the most common types of litter found. In Cardiff, where the council spends more than £7m a year on street cleaning, the worst performing \"D\" streets were found in some of the city's most deprived neighbourhoods, including Ely, Roath, Grangetown and Splott. Splott resident Malcolm Davies said the level of litter in and around his home was \"just a nightmare\". \"I live in the end house and we get whatever is chucked - fruit peelings, wrapping paper blowing into our garden,\" he said. \"We put it in our own bins to keep the garden tidy - but I'm getting too old now for all this litter picking.\" Fly-tipping was another problem, he said, adding he would like to see cameras installed to deter offenders. \"We've had it all - beds, settees, cabinets - everything,\" Mr Davies added. \"It's not very nice if you've got people coming down to visit, and all they can see is rubbish.\" Fellow Splott resident Lynne Thomas, who organises monthly volunteer litter picks, said much of the litter was caused by people incorrectly putting their bins out. \"The seagulls are getting savvy - if there's any food elements in any of the bags they're there in seconds - they will have it, they will shred it and strew it across the streets,\" she said. \"If everyone uses the right caddies and bags then that's one step towards keeping the streets cleaner.\" Ms Thomas said the situation could be upsetting. \"It can be heart-breaking to be honest - it can really affect people's mental health. \"People who've lived here all their lives and they've said to me lately that they're distressed by the amount of litter on the streets,\" she added. She urged people to \"be proactive and help each other out\" by joining litter picks, and reporting dumped waste to the council. The illegal dumping of waste, known as fly-tipping, is also an issue in the area. \"[This] is obviously an illegal fly-tip of what looks like domestic waste,\" explained Gareth Davies from Keep Wales Tidy, in reference to a large pile of rubbish in a gully between the housing estate and a main road. \"Often this isn't local residents, but rather people fly-tipping in other people's communities,\" he said. \"This has a huge impact - there's the mental health side of seeing litter every day as you walk in and out of the estate. \"But also things like the smell on a hot day, rats making home in your garden, even coming into your house.\" Cardiff councillor Norma Mackie, cabinet member for waste, said \"littering, whether dropped on the ground or thrown from vehicles, is caused by a few selfish people\". \"If litterers used the litter bins provided on the street, or disposed of rubbish at home after their journey, then the money which is currently being spent on this problem could be used for other services,\" she said. \"I've said it before and I'll say it again - people need to take responsibility for their actions.\" Councils in Wales collectively spent more than £64m on street cleaning in 2023-24. In the popular seaside resort of Barry Island, dealing with litter is an \"industrial exercise\", according to the leader of Vale of Glamorgan council Lis Burnett. The council deals with more than 250 tonnes of litter a year across Barry's beaches, costing around £800,000. \"Trying to find the money we need to provide these litter services is a real difficulty - we're all struggling with it,\" said Ms Burnett, who also represents the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA). The need for increased funding for education and social care had meant other budgets were being squeezed, she warned. \"It's a huge issue for every single local authority in Wales,\" she added. Both the WLGA and Keep Wales Tidy have urged the Welsh government to move ahead with delayed plans to force packaging producers to pay towards the costs of clearing litter. A long-awaited deposit return scheme for bottles and cans has also been held up following disagreements with the UK government over Wales' decision to include glass. Owen Derbyshire, Keep Wales Tidy's chief executive officer, said the Welsh government was \"taking important steps\" but needed a long-term plan for reducing street litter. \"This is a rising tide that we are really struggling to stop at the moment,\" he said, adding that huge increases in on-the-go food and drinks packaging were \"driving quite scary behaviours\". The charity wants mass public education campaigns, stronger enforcement of litter laws and \"a move away from single-use culture\". But Mr Derbyshire said this was not just a matter for the government or councils. \"Citizens, businesses, councils, and charities [should come] together to take shared responsibility for this growing problem,\" he said. The Welsh government said: \"Tackling litter and local environment issues is key and that is why we have provided Keep Wales Tidy with further funding to co-ordinate volunteer clean-up activities, monitor litter levels and deliver positive behaviour change campaigns right across the country.\" A spokesperson added that it had also introduced a new packaging extended producer responsibility scheme and was working on a deposit return scheme that worked for Wales, with both measures helping to reduce littering and waste.

    "title": "Soviet-era spacecraft 'likely' to have re-entered Earth's atmosphere",
    "content": "Part of a Soviet-era spacecraft is likely to have re-entered the Earth's atmosphere after being stuck in orbit for more than half a century, the European Space Agency said.  Kosmos 482, which launched in 1972 on a mission to Venus, never made it out of Earth's orbit and instead broke into four pieces that have been circling the planet for more than five decades.  The EU Space Surveillance and Tracking centre (SST) said one fragment - believed to be the lander - \"most likely\" re-entered the atmosphere at about 06:16 GMT (07:16 BST) on Saturday. It is unclear whether the object fell to the ground or burned up in the atmosphere. It is also unclear exactly where the object re-entered the atmosphere.  While there is much experts do not know about the object's re-entry, 70% of Earth is covered by sea so it is unlikely to have caused significant damage. \"It's much more likely that you win the lottery than that you get impacted by this piece of space debris,\" Stijn Lemmens, a senior analyst at the European Space Agency, said.  Kosmos 482's lander capsule was built to survive the extreme heat and pressure of Venus's atmosphere, meaning it had a robust heat shield and durable structure. This is why experts think it may have survived an uncontrolled descent through Earth's atmosphere. However, Kosmos 482's parachute system, originally intended to slow the lander's descent towards Venus, is likely to have degraded after more than 50 years in space. Mr Lemmens explained that the \"re-entry of human-made objects into Earth's atmosphere occurs quite frequently\". He said it happens weekly for bigger spacecraft and daily for smaller ones.  Objects typically burn up in the earth's atmosphere before they reach the ground.  China's Long March 5B booster re-entered over the Indian Ocean in 2022, and the Tiangong-1 space station mostly burned up over the Pacific in 2018. Kosmos 482 is now being closely tracked by international space agencies. Mr Lemmens said that future spacecraft \"should be designed in such a way that they can take themselves out of orbit safely, preferably by doing controlled re-entries\". This would allow for precise predictions of landing locations, reducing the risk of any debris impacting populated areas and protecting people and property while \"managing the environmental impact of space debris\".

    "title": "Blow to clean energy drive as major windfarm ditched",
    "content": "In a significant blow to the government's clean energy ambitions the Danish energy company Orsted has cancelled plans for a huge windfarm off the coast of East Yorkshire. The Hornsea 4 project would have become one of the biggest offshore wind farms in the world with a potential capacity of 2.4GW – enough to power more than a million homes. Orsted said the project no longer made economic sense, despite signing a 15-year contract with the UK government guaranteeing to sell power at an agreed price. The UK's offshore wind sector has faced soaring costs in recent years, as the government has acknowledged. A spokesperson for the Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) said it recognised \"the effect that globally high inflation and supply chain constraints are having on industry across Europe.\" But this is the second developer to pull out of a major offshore project. The Swedish company Vattenfall halted development of a 1.4GW wind farm off the coast of Norfolk in July 2023, again due to rising costs. Thay project was sold to the German energy company RWE, which has said it plans to see the project through. However, the difficulties offshore developers are facing raise significant questions about the viability of the government's clean power by 2030 target – one of the Labour government's five central \"missions\". Just over half of the country's power currently comes from wind, solar, nuclear and biomass – organic matter.  The government wants to raise that to 95% by 2030 – so in just five years' time. In order to meet that target the UK will need to triple offshore wind capacity and double the amount of solar and onshore wind power on the system, according to estimates by Aurora Energy. It will also need a significant upgrade to the electricity grid with 620 miles of new power lines as well as substations and other equipment. Many local communities are pushing back at the prospect of major new energy infrastructure near their homes. Some industry experts - as well as the Conservative and Reform parties – say the 2030 target is not achievable. Dieter Helm, professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford, has long argued building out this infrastructure in the timescale would be near impossible. \"In failing to meet a very short-term target, it is going to maximise the costs of trying,\" he has warned. Chris Stark, the head of the government's Clean Power 2030 mission, has conceded the target will be – as he put it - \"bloody hard\", but that with a \"Herculean effort\" it can be met. Energy Secretary, Ed Miliband, accepts the plan it is ambitious and controversial but is adamant that it is essential to: \"cut bills, tackle the climate crisis and give us energy security.\" The government has said it plans to work with Orsted to get Hornsea 4 \"back on track\" and said it believed the clean power mission was still achievable. \"We have a strong pipeline of projects to deliver clean power by 2030 and our mission-led approach ensures we can steer our way through global pressures and individual commercial decisions to reach our targets,\" a spokesperson said.

    "title": "Can this lynx born in a zoo learn to live in the wild?",
    "content": "As the door of its crate opens, the lynx sniffs the air, checks the coast is clear and cautiously takes its first steps toward freedom in Germany's Black Forest. A lynx born in a zoo in Cornwall could become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild. Animals born and raised in zoos are rarely considered for release because they either don't have the survival skills or have become too used to human interaction. But a shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding programme led to the unusual request being made for the cat from Newquay Zoo. It has been moved to Germany where it will spend the next few months being monitored in an enclosure to see if it's up to the challenge. This week the BBC watched on as, with the help of some judicious prodding with a broom, the Newquay lynx was loaded onto a truck headed for southwestern Germany. Two days later we were in Germany as it was cajoled into a 1,200-sq-metre enclosure. John Meek from Newquay Zoo was also on hand to see the lynx gingerly stroll out into its new home. \"I'm a big boy but I had a few tears in my eyes,\" he said. \" Nowadays, zoos are not here to keep animals in cages. They're there for conservation. And this is it, conservation in action.\" Thousands of lynx already roam wild in European forests but efforts are being made to introduce new cats to increase their genetic diversity particularly in central Europe.   Though not officially classed as a \"big cat\" Eurasian lynx can weigh up to 30 kilos and hunt deer for food.  Once native to the UK they were driven to extinction hundreds of years ago and with British deer populations at record levels there have been calls for their re-introduction.  \"Basically I'm Tinder for the zoo-born lynx,\" says Dina Gebhardt from Bern Animal Park with a smile when I speak to her on Zoom. It was her who sent out the SOS for the Newquay lynx.  The lynx-breeding coordinator for the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP), she matches females and males from across the continent as well as finding new homes for their offspring.  \"Our nature is very fragmented, due to railways and streets and cities. And this means we created a lot of barriers for the lynx, which leads to inbreeding,\" Dina says. To combat that Dina finds captive young lynx that can be introduced into the wild to increase numbers and improve the genetic mix. Usually Dina's lynxes have been raised from birth with the minimum of human contact, specifically with release in mind.  But last year, much to Dina's frustration, there was a particularly high number of male lynxes born. And a successful rewilding programme needs females much more  than males. So Dina reached out to Newquay Zoo to ask them if their one year old female might be available. \"Of course we said yes straight away, that's something that we'd love to do,\" says John Meek, the curator of plants and animals at Newquay Zoo.  Over the next few months the lynx will be monitored to see if it has the necessary skills to survive in the wild. Catching and killing prey is not expected to be a problem. \"If you know your cats, you know that even a cat that has lived in a room its whole life, once it gets out is able to kill a bird or a mouse,\" Eva Klebelsberg who runs the lynx reintroduction programme for Baden-Württemberg told us. We're standing over the carcass of a Roe Deer in the Black Forest just outside Karlsruhe. There is a small population of lynxes already living in the forest and this is one of their kills. There are puncture marks on its throat – a sure sign. \"Our ecosystems in Europe are missing large predators,\" Eva says, explaining that the lynx helps control populations of deer as well as ensuring that they keep moving and don't strip forested areas. The key question in relation to the Newquay lynx is likely to be its relationship with humans. Having spent its entire life looking through bars at visitors and being fed by keepers it will need to show that it is not going to seek out more human interaction. \"Central Europe is very crowded and we don't have many places where there is enough space for larger animals.\" says Dr Marco Roller from Karlsruhe zoo, who manages the enclosure.  \"We don't want human animal conflicts. So for us it's important we don't have aggressive animals or curious animals which may walk through cities or close to human settlements.\" The final decision on the Newquay lynx's fate will be taken later in the summer after several months of close monitoring.

    "title": "Sandeel fishing ban to remain in place",
    "content": "A challenge to Britain's ban on commercial fishing for sandeels in the North Sea has been dismissed in an international court. Sandeels are a vital source of food for marine life including seabirds that live along the UK coastline. Two bans for English and Scottish waters were put in place in early 2024 to prohibit trawlers netting the tiny fish, following concerns that sandeel stocks were becoming too low. Judges at the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) based in The Hague ruled there is no legal obligation to reverse the closure order after the EU claimed the move was \"discriminatory and disproportionate\", and could threaten the future of commercial sandeel fishing in Denmark. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), which manages Bempton Cliffs in East Yorkshire, was one of several conservation organisations that called for the measure to remain in place and gave evidence in the court hearing. Beccy Speight, the RSPB's chief executive, said: \"We are absolutely delighted the panel has found the ecological case for the closure of industrial sandeel fishing is sound.\" \"Safeguarding sandeel stocks is a key part of the jigsaw that will help set our puffins, kittiwakes and the wider marine environment on the path to recovery.\" The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) welcomed the court's decision and said it had found \"the UK successfully demonstrated that the measures taken to close English and Scottish waters were based on the best available science\". Sandeels comprise a number of species of small fish and are caught commercially for use in animal feed and in oil production. Danish fishing organisations had argued that the North Sea ban was \"unnecessary\" and claimed sandeel stocks were plentiful, disputing the scientific evidence. Speaking before the court ruling Esben Sverdrup-Jensen, from the Danish Pelagic Producers' Association, said the ban had a \"massive impact\" on the industry. \"It means we have lost about half of the fishing grounds that we have traditionally fished on for decades,\" he said. Mr Sverdrup-Jensen disputed the claim that sandeel stocks were under threat. \"Sandeel is probably the best managed fishery in the world,\" he added. The ruling means a sandeel fishing ban also remains in place in the Scottish areas of the North Sea and this has been welcomed by the Scottish government, which has continuing concerns about the seabird population.  Scotland's Rural Affairs Secretary, Mairi Gougeon, said: \"Protecting our marine ecosystem is vital to Scotland's environment, and to the people and communities who rely on it.  \"The ruling reaffirms the appropriateness of the actions we took last year to do just that.\" The Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling, which runs to nearly 300 pages, also stated the ban in English waters breached the post-Brexit trade deal because it was \"disproportionate\". In a statement, the European Commission said it welcomed the ruling as it \"provides clarity\" on fishing rights. It said: \"The UK is required to immediately comply with the final ruling and shall inform the EU within 30 days of the [compliance] measures it will take\". A Defra spokesperson said it would \"bring the UK into compliance\" on this issue but the ruling did not mean the UK is legally obliged to reverse the closure of English waters.

    "title": "NHS plans 'unthinkable' cuts to balance books",
    "content": "The NHS in England is planning \"previously unthinkable\" cuts to try to balance the books, health bosses say. Services including diabetes care for young people, rehab centres and talking therapies are in the firing line, according to NHS Providers, which represents health managers. Staff, including doctors and nurses, also face the axe - and some NHS trusts are stopping overtime for doctors, putting the drive to cut the hospital waiting lists at risk. NHS Providers said some of the savings were \"eye-watering\", but the Department of Health and Social Care said NHS services should focus on cutting bureaucracy and driving up productivity.   The figures come after initial accounts for 2025-26 suggested frontline NHS organisations were going to go nearly £7bn over budget, an overspend nearly 5% above what they have been given by government, despite ministers increasing funding by £22bn over two years. One chief executive of a large hospital trust said it was looking to shed 1,500 jobs, some 5% of its workforce, including doctors and nurses. Meanwhile, a boss of a mental health trust told the BBC they had had to stop accepting referrals for adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), while waits for psychological therapies exceeded a year. They said morale had \"never been lower\" among staff. Other services at risk include stop smoking services and palliative care. The closure of some maternity units is also being considered, although part of that is down to the falling birth rate which has seen a number of services being under-used.   NHS Providers received evidence from 114 trusts, more than half of the total in England. Nearly all said they were cutting or planning to cut jobs which in many cases would affect clinical staff such as doctors and nurses too. A majority also reported they were looking at closing services or at least scaling them back. NHS Providers interim chief executive Saffron Cordery said NHS managers were having to think the \"previously unthinkable\". And she said while they would do their best to protect patient care, she added: \"Let's be clear. Cuts have consequences.\" She said pay rises for resident doctors - previously known as junior doctors - and inflation had eaten into the extra money the health service had been given. But the Department of Health and Social Care said the extra funding being provided should be enough. A spokeswoman said: \"We have underlined the need for trusts to cut bureaucracy to invest even further in the front line so we can support hard-working staff and deliver a better service for patients and taxpayers' money.\" Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "title": "More blood victims will die without compensation - minister",
    "content": "More victims of the infected blood scandal will die without ever receiving full compensation, a government minister has said. The paymaster general Nick Thomas-Symonds was giving evidence to a special session of the public inquiry into what's been called the worst treatment disaster in NHS history. It's thought 30,000 patients in the UK were infected with HIV or hepatitis B and C after being treated with a contaminated blood clotting product or given a blood transfusion in the 1970s and 80s. Mr Thomas-Symonds agreed it was \"profoundly unsatisfactory\" that just 106 final compensation awards have been paid, almost a year after a damning report into the scandal was published. \"I'm never going to think this is satisfactory until everybody has received the compensation that is due,\" the Cabinet Office minister said. \"The objective should be absolutely to pay [people] as soon as possible.\" A final report into the scandal, published last year, found that the disaster could largely have been avoided if different decisions had been taken by the health authorities at the time. The report said too little was done to stop the importing of contaminated blood products from abroad in the 1970s and 80s, and there was evidence that elements of the scandal had been covered up. Last month the chair of the public inquiry, Sir Brian Langstaff, ordered two days of extra hearings after he received \"letter after letter, email after email\" expressing concerns about the way the government's compensation scheme has been managed. The Chancellor Rachel Reeves set aside £11.8bn in the last budget to make final awards to victims and their family members, but the latest figures show less than 1% of that total, some £97m, has been paid out to date. Survivors of the scandal and some bereaved relatives have also received a series of smaller interim compensation payments over the last three years. Eleven victims and their representatives gave evidence in an emotional panel session in front of an audience of around 300 people in Westminster. Andrew Evans, chair of the campaign group Tainted Blood, told the hearing many victims and their families had been left feeling \"betrayed and disappointed\". \"People have given up on any expectation of receiving anything,\" he said. \"They have lost all hope of ever getting justice and we can't be doing this for much longer.\" Other witnesses criticised the way in which individuals were being contacted and \"invited\" to come forward to claim final compensation, describing it as \"waiting for your lottery ticket to come up\". Gary Webster, a haemophiliac who was infected with HIV and hepatitis C when a pupil at Treloar's School in Hampshire in the 1970s and 80s, said that \"[some] people will not get their compensation and a lot of claims will die with them.\" \"It's just too slow and people won't get the justice they deserve,\" he added. Under the current rules, if someone infected with HIV or hepatitis B or C dies before receiving full compensation, then any final award can be passed on to their relatives through their estate. But compensation can also be claimed by those affected by the scandal – a partner, sibling or parent of a child, for example – for the separate impact on their lives. And if they die before that compensation is agreed, then their claim will die with them and cannot be passed on. In questioning later in the day, Mr Thomas-Symonds, who leads on the response for the government, said he was \"restless for further progress on payments\". The Infected Blood Compensation Authority (IBCA), an independent body set up to pay victims of the scandal, has said it expects the \"bulk\" of awards to be made to infected survivors by the end of 2027, with most of those affected, such as family members and carers, paid by the end of 2029. Mr Thomas-Symonds said he regarded that timeline as a \"backstop\" rather than a target to work towards. \"The logic for that is there may be other people who have not yet come forward at this stage [to claim],\" he said. \"I've never been anything but clear they are absolute backstops and I expect these payments to speed up [in the future].\" Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.

    "title": "'The NHS at its worst', ex-ombudsman tells inquiry",
    "content": "A former health ombudsman has condemned mental health services for their handling of two vulnerable young men who died in their care. Sir Rob Behrens, who was parliamentary and health service ombudsman (PHSO) from 2017 to 2024, spoke at the Lampard Inquiry, which is examining the deaths of more than 2,000 people under mental health services in Essex over a 24-year period. Sir Rob said it was \"a disgrace\" how Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust (EPUT) had failed in its care of 20-year-old Matthew Leahy, who died in 2012, and a 20-year-old man referred to as Mr R, who died in 2008. \"This was the National Health Service at its worst and needed calling out,\" Sir Rob said. Sir Rob referred in his inquiry appearance to several reports made during his tenure, including \"Missed Opportunities\", which looked into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Mr Leahy and Mr R. Mr Leahy was found unresponsive at the Linden Centre in Chelmsford. He reported being raped there just days before he died. Sir Rob told the inquiry the PHSO identified \"19 instances of maladministration\" in Mr Leahy's case by North Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust - a predecessor to EPUT - including that his care plan was falsified. The former ombudsman said there had been \"a near-complete failure of the leadership of this trust, certainly before it was merged\" with South Essex Partnership Trust to become EPUT. \"This was an indictment of the health service,\" he added. Sir Rob paid tribute to Matthew's mother, Melanie Leahy, who campaigned for more than a decade for a public inquiry, calling her \"an exemplary complainant\". \"She was very well prepared for every meeting, she was courteous but assertive. She knew what she wanted out of an investigation. \"Given the tragedy that she'd been through, it was a remarkable contribution to public life that she performed over many years,\" Sir Rob said. He also said that the way some doctors spoke about Mr R was \"staggering\". Mr R was found unresponsive in the Linden Centre in December 2008 and died afterwards. Sir Rob Behrens found he had been failed multiple times by those treating him. \"Some clinicians were interviewed after he died, and they had a very patronising approach to him\" he told the inquiry. \"In their view, [Mr R] didn't have mental health problems at all, and he had been admitted because he wanted somewhere to live because he was homeless. That is staggering.\" In a report called \"Broken Trust\", published in 2023, Sir Rob referenced there were more than a dozen different health and care regulators playing important roles in patient safety. \"Political leaders have created a confusing landscapes of organisations, often in knee-jerk reaction to patient safety crisis points,\" the report said. Sir Rob agreed with a suggestion put to him by Nicholas Griffin KC, chief counsel to the inquiry, that some incidents \"fall through the gaps\" due to the complexity of the complaints process and therefore are not investigated. \"There are a lot of people who simply don't know where to go,\" Sir Rob said. \"At the moment, I have no confidence that people trust the system because they don't know where to go when they want to make a complaint.\" Sir Rob said that Essex was \"not exceptional\" and the issues he had discovered there could be seen in other places as well. \"The absence of leadership… not communicating effectively with patients, the safety issues around ligature points… and the absence of training and development - these are still issues which the NHS has to address generally, not just in Essex,\" he said. The former ombudsman also told the inquiry that he was prevented from investigating a significant number of deaths due to a \"serious limitation\" in his office's powers. Sir Rob Behrens explained the ombudsman could only investigate following a complaint, but that for understandable reasons of bereavement or trauma, many families in Essex did not complain following the deaths of loved ones. Sir Rob said if the ombudsman had the power to take its own initiative then \"the resolution of these tragic issues could have been speeded up very dramatically\". EPUT chief executive Paul Scott has apologised for deaths under his trust's care. He said: \"As the inquiry progresses, there will be many accounts of people who were much loved and missed over the past 24 years and I want to say how sorry I am for their loss.\" The Lampard Inquiry will hear evidence across several sessions until July 2026, with Baroness Lampard's report likely to be published in 2027.

    "title": "Big baby trial gives pregnant women more choice ",
    "content": "Women pregnant with larger babies have been given the option to choose how and when to give birth in a bid to lessen the risk of injury to the child. The \"big baby\" trial aimed to find out if starting labour earlier than 38 weeks made it less likely for infants who appeared large in the womb to be born with shoulder dystocia, where the shoulder becomes stuck during delivery. Study findings from between 2018 and 2022 showed giving birth a week to 10 days earlier reduced the risk, researchers said. It is hoped the data from the £2.5m Coventry-based trial will give doctors and midwives more confidence in facilitating natural births.  Coventry nurse Eve Morgan took part in the study 2018 after monitoring found her baby could reach 9lb (4kg). Ms Morgan, who developed gestational diabetes when she was pregnant, had a cervical sweep to help bring on her choice of a natural labour. As a result, she safely delivered her 7lbs 8oz boy (3.4kg) 10 days early.  \"They said [the] baby grows so much in the last kind of week or so,\" she said. \"I'm quite petite myself. They said he would have been big for me.\" The trial was led by Siobhan Quenby, a professor of obstetrics at the University of Warwick and consultant at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire (UHCW) NHS Trust, in partnership with the Perinatal Institute, Birmingham.   Results were gathered from 2,893 women in 106 hospitals in the UK, who consented to be randomly allocated to induction or standard delivery. Shoulder dystocia occurs in 1 in 150 vaginal deliveries, delaying birth and leading to possible complications, including a stretching in the nerves of the infant's neck. The NHS says the condition occurs more often in bigger babies but there is uncertainty over how often. It is estimated it could affect 1 in 25 women with a big baby who have a vaginal delivery. Large babies are defined as those who weigh more than 90% of other babies the same age, the NHS said. Prof Quenby said the trial findings empowered women to decide \"how and when they want to deliver their baby\". Trial data crucially revealed babies did not suffer more harm if they were delivered later. It also showed earlier delivery reduced the need for emergency Caesarean section and did not increase the risk of tearing. \"Whether you're induced at 38 weeks or whether you choose to wait for a natural labour, in both groups the baby's outcomes were the same,\" Prof Quenby said. \"Both groups had a risk of shoulder dystocia, it was actually slightly higher if you waited for labour naturally - but babies didn't do any worse if you wait for labour naturally.\" She added all the babies were born in an NHS hospital, where staff were trained on delivering natural births. Komal Mehmood, from Coventry, is 38-weeks pregnant with her second child, which is measuring as large.  She said she found the results of the trial helpful when deciding her birth plan. \"I mean it's a natural process at the end of the day,\" she said. \"I understand the baby's big, but I'm confident that waiting for a normal birth shouldn't be a problem.\" Asked if the data had offered her reassurance she said: \"Definitely it does.\" The trial was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research and the results published in the medical journal, The Lancet.

    "title": "Plan to modernise 1,000 GP practice buildings",
    "content": "Funding is being given to around one in six GP practices in England to help them improve their buildings, the government says. Around £102m is being provided to expand and modernise surgeries, with work getting under way this summer. The government said it was the biggest public investment in facilities for five years. It comes as satisfaction levels with GP service have hit record-low levels and figures suggest two in five GPs are reporting their practices are not fit for purpose. Health Secretary Wes Streeting called it a \"significant step\", but warned it would not solve all existing problems overnight. Under the plan, some of the projects will involve converting office space into clinical consulting rooms as well as building new practices. Mr Streeting said: \"These are simple fixes for our GP surgeries, but for too long they were left to ruin, allowing waiting lists to build and stopping doctors treating more patients. \"It is only because of the necessary decisions we took in the Budget that we are able to invest in GP surgeries, start tackling the 08:00 scramble and deliver better services for patients,\" he added. Prof Kamila Hawthorne, of the Royal College of GPs, described the funding announcement as an \"encouraging interim measure\", but said long-term investment would be needed to tackle the \"inadequate infrastructure\". \"This not only makes for a poor experience for both patients and practice staff, but it restricts the care and services a practice can provide,\" she said. The British Social Attitudes survey, published last month, found that just 31% of people in the UK were satisfied with NHS GP services - compared to 68% in 2019. Research by the Institute for Government, an independent think-tank, found that patient satisfaction with GPs had fallen significantly since the pandemic, driven by fewer in-person appointments. Around 80% of patients saw a GP in person in 2019. By last year, that had fallen to 66%. Ruth Rankine, the primary care director at the NHS Confederation, said doctors would welcome the £102m boost to \"deliver high quality care, closer to home, and fit for the 21st century\". \"If we are serious about shifting care from hospital to community, from sickness to prevention, and from analogue to digital, then sustained investment in primary and community estates, equipment and technology is vital,\" she added. It is unclear which of the 6,252 GP surgeries in NHS England will benefit from the new funding. Last month the government announced it would expand a scheme to help GPs provide care to patients without admitting them to hospital - backed by £80m in funding.

    "title": "'Doctors told my mum poison symptoms were anxiety'",
    "content": "The daughter of a couple who were fatally poisoned with fentanyl by a family friend said doctors told her mother she had anxiety as her health deteriorated from the effects of the drug.  Luke D'Wit was jailed in  2024 for the murder of Carol Baxter, 64, and her husband Stephen, 61, who died from an overdose in West Mersea, Essex. Ellena Baxter told the BBC her mother had Hashimoto's disease, a thyroid condition, and became increasingly unwell over the two years preceding her death with her family noticing \"dramatic changes\". She said: \"She was majorly confused, it was like the wires were getting crossed in her brain. She would make cold cups of tea and iron shirts on top of the hob.\" The murders were the focus of a recent two-part ITV documentary, called Essex Millionaire Murders.  Mrs Baxter visited her GP, private healthcare, endocrinologists, neurologists and was treated at Colchester Hospital after suffering blackouts, flushes, headaches and feeling itchy and uncomfortable. However, her daughter said she was continuously told she was suffering with a form of anxiety.  \"[Luke D'Wit] was quadrupling the dosage of drugs and mixing up his own concoctions of drugs and putting them into capsules and feeding them to my mum as vitamins. \"She attended A&E and Luke D'Wit, inside the pill capsules, put little metal tacks, and she got a little metal screw stuck in her intestine… she had been to multiple services at this point trying to get answers,\" Ellena said.  The 23-year-old said seeing her mother suffer had been \"devastating\". \"To see someone so full of life, so full of love just fade away. She died on the 9 April 2023 but she actually died a long time before that.\" As part of his manipulation of the Baxters, D'Wit created a fake doctor, called Andrea Bowden, who gave Mrs Baxter advice about her condition and put her in touch with a wide network of pretend patients. \"When this Dr Andrea did come about it was just a little bit of hope for all of us… she had been fobbed off so many times at this point by doctors, by the NHS, we just wanted answers,\" Ellena added.  With the help of Dr Andrea, Ellena said the family hoped her mother would recover. Ellena said a toxicology test was never offered to her mother by any doctor, but if one had been the fentanyl she had been ingesting might have showed up in the results. She said: \"We would have taken [all her medication] away and started from scratch... if you take the vitamins away, who was doing the vitamins? \"We would have known [D'Wit] was then doing something he shouldn't, especially when Mum would have started getting better.\" Ellena has called for toxicology tests to be offered to NHS patients who have unexplained symptoms when all other tests have been exhausted, under what she has named \"Carol's Law\". \"I need [toxicology tests] to be routinely offered... it is missing people. \"Something needs to change and if I can help make that change through Carol's Law, then that is what I'm wanting to do.\" She said one of the places Mrs Baxter received treatment was Colchester Hospital, however, the East Suffolk and North Essex NHS has said it could not comment directly on the care of individuals.  The trust added it offered toxicology tests when a patient was unconscious and in the critical care unit or if someone is pregnant and believed to be using drugs which could harm their baby.  Dr Tim Leary, the chief medical officer at East Suffolk and North Essex NHS, encouraged anyone with concerns over family member's care to get in touch through the trust's patient advice and liaison service.
